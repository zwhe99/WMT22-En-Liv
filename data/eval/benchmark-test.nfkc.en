Monthly item – Livonian Summer University and the Lāži Oak
The tradition of the Livonian Summer University since the beginning in 2013 has been a photograph of its participants at the famous Lāžu Oak on the Livonian Coast.
From July 30 to August 8, 2021, the third Livonian Summer University took place in Košrags, organized by the UL Livonian Institute in cooperation with the University of Tartu.
During the Livonian Summer University, the participants learned Livonian, met with Livonian speakers, got acquainted with the Livonian history, culture and learnt about the situation nowadays; one of the topics also including the last historical settlement of the Livonians – the Livonian Coast, which is why it was chosen as the venue of the Livonian Summer University.
The tradition of the Livonian Summer University since the beginning in 2013 has been a photograph of its participants at the famous Lāži Oak on the Livonian Coast.
Lāži Oak has been the decor and treasure of the Lāži homestead in the village of Vaide for at least two hundred years.
Nika Polmanis (1823), the first professionally educated Livonian teacher, was born in Lāži homestead; since the 60s of the 19th century, the Launičs’ family, whose representative Andrejs Launičs wrote descriptions of Livonian weddings and household customs in the 19th century. The Lāži house has also been a Livonian elementary school children (1923–1937).
At the end of the 1930s, Alfons Bertholds (1910–1993) – a fisherman, a Livonian poet, and a connoisseur of Livonian folklore – became the owner of Lāži homestead, and even now the Bertholds’ family still lives near the Lāži oak.
Livonian Summer University has ended, but some of it's moments may be re-experienced through the Latvian TV.
Once more – many, many thanks to all of participants and supporters – University of Tartu ASTRA project PER ASPERA, The Ministry of Education and Science, University of Latvia and other friends.
Special thanks to Talsu TV for the hearth warming meeting and Marc Daniel Skibsted Volhardt, Tuuli Tuisk and Miina Norvik for sharing your experiences.

We wish you success learning about Livonian culture!
The Livonians are a Finnic people indigenous to Latvia and have had great significance in the development of the modern Latvian language and culture.
Latvian formed as a result of contact between Livonian and several ancient Baltic nations – the Latgalians, Semigallians, and Curonians – and its unique characteristics arose specifically as a result of this mutual influence.
Likewise, the influence of Livonian can be felt throughout Latvian traditional and contemporary culture from folklore to culinary traditions.
For this reason, Livonian traditional culture has been incorporated into the Latvian cultural canon and the role of Livonian traditions in the formation of Latvian identity is emphasized in the preamble of the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia.
The Livonians have managed to maintain their language and culture up to the present day, and have continued to develop it as they have become part of the modern cultural space of Latvia.
Unlike Latvian, which is a part of the Baltic branch of the Indo-European language family, Livonian belongs to the Finnic branch of the Uralic language family.
The closest linguistic relatives of Livonian are Estonian, Finnish, and Karelian, more distant ones include Sámi, Hungarian, Mordvin, and other Uralic languages.
Livonian is listed in the UNESCO Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger as a critically endangered language.
The status of Livonian in Latvia is defined in Article 4 of the State Language Law: “The state ensures the preservation, safeguarding, and development of Livonian as an indigenous (autochthonous) language.”
Since 2009, the Livonian language, as a component of Livonian traditional culture, has been included in the Latvian cultural canon.
In the 19th century, Livonian still had approximately 3000 speakers, by the mid-20th century around 1500 speakers, but presently there may be at best 30 people in the world who can communicate in Livonian.
The number of individuals who have learned the basics of Livonian, however, continues to increase.
Knowledge about Livonian and also proficiency in it is important for understanding the nature of Latvian, as both languages have influenced each other through longstanding contact.
Though it has few speakers, Livonian is important for those researching Uralic languages, as it is unique and contains many ancient features.
Likewise, language knowledge is fundamental for the Livonians themselves, as it has been precisely language which has always been at the foundation of their sense of identity.
Presently, it is possible to learn Livonian through self-study, in courses, or at camps as well as at some universities.
Hopefully, in the future it will also be possible to learn Livonian online.
The Livonians are unique not only because of their language and history, but also due to their rich cultural heritage. Learn more about it in the Traditional Culture section.
The Livonians have continued to develop their culture in modern times. Their contemporary art, music, and literature traditions stretch back for nearly 200 years.
Learn more about Livonian culture in the present in the Contemporary Culture section.
The Library brings together all types of publicly available information on the Livonians.
Here you can find different studies on Livonian history and culture (studies on Livonian language can be found in lingua.livones.net), books, internet resources, videos etc.
This section is updated on an ongoing basis with current publications and news.
Liivlaste lood (Livonian Stories), by Enn Säde, was filmed between 1988 and 1990.
It features Oskars Stalte, Elfrīda Žagare, Alfons Bertholds, Paulīne Kļaviņa, Andris Zēbergs, and Irma Fridrihsone.
This movie utilizes footage from the Estonian Film Archive (Eesti Filmiarhiiv) and the Estonian Television Archive (Eesti Telefilmi arhiiv).
The script author and director was Enn Säde and the cameraman was Ago Ruus.
Līvõ lōlõd (Livonian Songs) is the first documentary film made in Latvia about the Livonians.
This film was its author, director, and cameraman Andris Slapiņš’ diploma work at the All-Union State Institute of Cinematography (Всесоюзный государственный институт кинематографии).
The Estonian Television film Liivi rannal (On the Livonian Coast) gives a glimpse into the daily life of the Kurzeme Livonians in the 1960s.
Many well-known Livonians appear in this film (Hilda Grīva, Katrīna Krāsona, and others).
This film is primarily in Livonian and Estonian. A number of Livonian folk songs and other more contemporary Livonian compositions are also featured in this film.
The director of the film is Endel Nõmberg, screenplay writers – Eduard Vääri and Ants Vist.
Viktors Bertholds – a Livonian, fisherman, healer – 100
Viktors Bertholds’ (1921–2009) own familiy was the last one to still speak Livonian on a daily basis, at least while his wife Marta (b. Liedāne, 1925–1994) was still alive, V. Bertholds was also one of whom Estonian and Finnish scholars visited and the last, with whom one could freely speak the native Livonian language on the coast.
On January 16, 2021, we commemorate Viktors Bertholds’ 100th anniversary.
Larger part of his life Viktors Bertholds lived in Kolka.
He joined the Livonian affairs in the more recent times, when there were few Livonian speakers, when each speaker’s value had grown greatly.
In the early 1990s, Viktors and Marta taught the Livonian language to his colleagues.
As long as he was able, on the first Saturday of each August Viktors was always present at the Livonian festival in Mazirbe.
Viktors Bertholds was born on January 16, 1921 in the family of Kārlis and Marija Bertholds in Vaide in Žonaki.
For at least six generations, Žonaki was home to the vast and strong Livonian Berthold family, from where a number of important figures in the Livonian cultural history have come.
Both with their brother Alfons Bertholds (Livonian poet, folklore narrator), growing up in a strictly Livonian family, they kept the Livonian language alive throughout their lives.
It was the descendants of the Bertholds’ family who were the best native speakers of the Livonian language today.

Although on paper, the family of Viktors and Marta Bertholds’ was actually the last one on the coast which spoke Livonian to each other on a daily basis, both children did not learn the Livonian language.
Daughter Āria Bertholde, who has moved to the United States with her daughter Baiba since 1995, recalled:
We always spoke Livonian in our house on a daily basis.
Even when parents did not want their children to understand what they were talking about.
I wanted to learn the language.
Now I know only a few words, and I remember a few songs.
I thought I could read because I remember my mother teaching me how to read umlauts.
When I asked my mother why she was not taught the language, mother said that it was an unrecognized and unauthorized language.

The summer of 2008 was the first when Viktors’ place on the bench at the Livonian Festival was left empty.
Viktors Bertholds passed away at the age of eighty-eight on February 23, 2009.
He is at rest in the Kolka cemetery.

2011 - YEAR OF THE LIVONIAN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
The International Livonian Friends’ Society and the association Līvõ Kultūr sidām (Livonian Culture Centre) have come up with a decision to announce year 2011 the International Year of the Livonian Language and Culture.
The idea is based on a number of reasons both with significant culture and historic value and the reasons of current importance. Consequently, the year 2011 seems to be marked with quite unique events.
In 2011 it is 150 years since the first Livonian grammar book and a dictionary was published in German by A.J.Sjogren and F.J.Wiedemann, in the Russian Academy of Sciences, Petersburg. The book also contained the first samples of Livonian folklore, poetry and religious texts.
90 years ago the first non-religious book in Livonian was published – Līvõd ežmi lugdõbrōntõz (The First Livonian Reader), the start of a series of article collections by the Estonian Academic Native Language Society (Akadeemiline Emakeele Selts).
80 years have passed since supported by the Finnish Academic Club of Related Nations (Akateeminen Heimoklubi) the first Livonian periodical, a newspaper Līvli saw the daylight.
75 years ago Kārlis Stalte, a Livonian, wrote the first Livonian language ABC commissioned by the Estonian Academic Native Language Society. Five years ago its manuscript was found in the State Archives of Estonia.
20 years ago the State Protected Culture Historic Territory Līvõd rānda (The Livonian Coast) was founded and the Livonians were declared indigenous nation in Latvia following the Law of the Republic of Latvia On Free Development Of National And Ethnic Groups And Their Rights To Culture Autonomy.
Also, it is five years of livones.lv next year, the Livonian culture and language portal, the only mass medium to provide information in Livonian, Latvian, English and partly in Finnish and Estonian.
The Livonian language and culture is not only a historic value covered by the dust of long centuries.
It is still a source of significant research to make our modern culture richer and to lead to discoveries of both scientific and practical value.
In 2011, the so far most voluminous Livonian-Estonian-Latvian dictionary will be published in Estonia.
It is compiled by prof. em. Tiit-Rein Viitso, the most outsatnding contemporary Livonian researcher, based on a variety of Livonian text samples including the collected material by Pēteris Dambergs, a Livonian.
The new dictionary which contains also the grammar of the Livonian language is going to be a perfect study aid with authentic language samples.
On 10 December, 2010, at the University of Tartu, Valts Ernštreits was conferred a doctor’s degree for his first original research The Formation of the Written Livonian Language. In 2011, a book will be published based on the same research.
International scientific conferences, exhibitions and other events in Latvia and Estonia will be held.
During the International Year of the Livonian Language and Culture, University of Tartu, Estonian Language Institute, Native Language Society (Estonia) will be the main cooperation partners of the International Livonian Friends’ Society and Livonian Culture Centre while the Latvian partnership is represented by Latvian Academy of Sciences, Latvian Language Agency, Latvian National History Museum, etc
Coordination in Latvia – Valts Ernštreits, Estonia – Tuuli Tuisk and Finland – Tapio Mäkeläinen.

Epilogue
Livonian is the ancient language of the indigenous people of Latvia that belongs among Finno-Ugric languages.
In the 12th century, it was spoken in the territory of modern Latvia around the Gulf of Riga, in the northern part of the Courland Peninsula, at the lower course of the Gauja and Daugava rivers and also around the present capital of Latvia, Riga.
The Livonians gradually blended into neighbouring peoples, becoming part of the contemporary Latvian people and making a strong mark on the Latvian language.
In the 19th century, Livonian was spoken in two regions of Latvia.
One of them was around the Svētupe river on the eastern coast of the Gulf of Riga, where at least 22 people spoke Vidzeme or Salaca Livonian.
Here, it didn’t take long for Livonian to disappear.
The second place was the Livonian Coast, which covers 14 fishing villages from Oviši to Ģipka and where about 2,500 people spoke Courland Livonian.
The number of Livonian speakers decreased in Courland as well in the 20th century.
This was accelerated by the two world wars as well as the Soviet occupation, but the Livonians, their supporters among other Finno-Ugric peoples and in Latvia still actively participated in the preservation and development of the Livonian language and culture.
The entire Livonian Coast was turned into a border zone in the 1950s, as it was now the western border of the Soviet Union.
Fishing, which had been the main livelihood of the Livonians for a long time, and access to the sea were restricted.
Many Livonians moved to bigger cities in search for work, most to Riga and Ventspils. 
Farms were abandoned and the last region where Livonian was spoken in all villages ceased to exist.
The Livonians who’d left were soon replaced by Latvians and their language is now the main one heard on the Livonian Coast.
Today, many Livonians live in Riga, Ventspils, Kūolka and elsewhere in Latvia.
According to the census of 2011, 250 people in Latvia identify themselves as Livonians.
The Livonian language has been entered into the UNESCO list of endangered languages.
There are only a little over 20 people in the world who can speak Livonian.
Among them are the three authors of this book.
Therefore, it can be said that whilst Livonian literature is undoubtedly the smallest literature in Europe in terms of the number of readers, it’s also the biggest when the number of writers among Livonian speakers is taken into account.
The impact and meaning of the Livonian language and culture actually reach much further than the current number of Livonians and Livonian speakers might suggest.
Livonians have played an important role in the history of the Baltic region and in the development of modern Latvian language and culture.
There are many well-known contemporary Latvian writers, composers, artists, statesmen and other intellectuals whose ancestors are Livonians.
After losing their land and their language, Livonians have worked hard to keep their perception and heritage – this has helped the Livonian language and culture to survive to this day.
It’s important that over a period of almost 200 years, Livonians have managed to develop their contemporary culture in addition to preserving their heritage.
It has developed consistently alongside the culture of the neighbouring peoples of the Livonians – the Latvians and the Estonians.
This means that not only have the Livonians kept their language and traditions alive, they’ve also developed their written language and new cultural traditions, which are expressed in the works of Livonian poets, artists, composers and other creative people.
Origins of Livonian literature
The first Livonian words can be found in the Livonian Chronicle of Henry, which was written in the 13th century and is an important document in the study of the history of the Livonians and the entire Baltic region.
The first texts in Livonian were probably printed in the 16th century.
However, the majority of the Livonian texts published before the mid-19th century were mostly written down as examples of the language that were not meant for the Livonians themselves, such as the first books in Livonian printed in London in 1863 – the Gospel of Matthew in the western and eastern dialects of Courland Livonian.
The first book that was actually meant for the Livonians was also a translation of the Gospel of Matthew, which was made on the basis of the translations mentioned above and published in 1880 in St Petersburg.
The first examples of Livonian fiction were published in the middle of the 19th century when St Petersburg academics Anders Johan Sjögren and Ferdinand Johann Wiedemann visited the Livonians.
The first Livonian grammar book compiled by them, which included examples of the language and a Livonian-German-Livonian dictionary, was published in 1861 in St Petersburg.
The poems written by Jāņ Prints and his son Pētõr Prints were published among other examples of the language, i.e. proverbs, folk songs, legends and descriptions of traditions, and became the first examples of Livonian fiction.
Jāņ Prints senior was a Livonian fisherman and writer from the village of Pizā, where he also served as a sexton for many years.
Later, he settled in Ventspils, where he founded the Ostgals district of the city. One of the streets in Ventspils – Prinču iela or Prints Street – has been named in honour of the Prints family.
Jāņ Prints lived in Ventspils until his death.
He was a talented linguist and writer.
This is evidenced by the Livonian neologisms he created and also offered to both of the aforementioned researchers from St Petersburg, as well as his articles in Latvian press.
Jāņ Prints had already written several articles in Latvian and Livonian by the time Sjögren and Wiedemann arrived.
He had also done some translations.
Jāņ Prints believed that he had to pass the beautiful, pure and rich Livonian language on to future generations and show that Livonian was a cultural language equal to any bigger European language.
This is probably the reason why Jāņ Prints wrote his first poems in Livonian and did his first translations.
Jāņ Prints senior also played an important role in Latvian literature.
His Latvian book of poems Jūrnieku svētās dziesmas un lūgšanas (Holy Songs and Prayers of Seamen), which he wrote with his elder son Jāņ, was published in 1845 in Mitau, i.e. Jelgava.
This was the second collection of original poetry in the literary history of Latvia.
When you read the poems written by Jāņ Prints more than 170 years ago, you have to admire the stylistic methods he used, as they feel very contemporary, how well he thought through the imagery and rhythm of his poems.
His texts make you think that history should’ve been different.
If Jāņ Prints had had the chance to learn more about culture not only in the world of fishing villages, but elsewhere as well, he might’ve developed into a noteworthy and bright 19th century cultural icon throughout Europe and not in Latvia and the Baltic States alone.
Livonian literature in the 20th century
Livonian literature started developing rapidly after World War I, when the ideas of the romantic nationalism of the 19th century had started spreading again in Europe and several new nation states were born in the wake of the collapse of empires.
When Latvia, Estonia and Finland emerged from the ruins of the Russian Empire, the Livonians once again found themselves under the spotlight as an important part of the region’s history.
Estonian and Finnish scientists and cultural figures were the ones who have special attention to the Livonians.
They were captivated by the idea of kindred peoples speaking Finno-Ugric languages in Europe where Indo-European languages are mostly spoken.
The activities of these researchers and creative persons were also influenced by the fact that studying Finno-Ugric peoples other than the Sami and the Hungarians and cooperation with them was difficult at the time, as they remained in the newly established Soviet Union.
Thus, many Estonian and Finnish scientists suddenly became interested in the Livonians, they started studying and helping them, and the Finns and the Estonians also strongly supported the attempts to preserve the language and culture of the Livonians.
The first and most noteworthy of the researchers who arrived on the Livonian Coast were Lauri Kettunen (1885–1963) from Finland, who was a professor of Baltic-Finnic languages in the University of Tartu and the compiler of the Livonian-German dictionary published in 1938, and Estonian Oskar Loorits (1900–1961), a student of Lauri Kettunen and later a collector and researcher of Livonian folklore.
During their first expedition to Livonian villages in 1920 to collect material about the Livonian language and culture, the two researchers urged the Livonians to give more attention to their heritage, which had to be preserved and developed.
This is why they helped to create and boost Livonian culture, establish choirs and the first Livonian social organisation the Livonian Union, helped to teach Livonian in schools, etc.
Creating possibilities for the publication of Livonian texts was one of their most important tasks.
Lauri Kettunen and Oskar Loorits published the first Livonian chrestomathy already in 1921 and continued publishing such chrestomathies until 1926.
The poems and stories written by the Livonians themselves were published in the chrestomathies alongside folklore and articles written by the compilers themselves.
These books and the monthly Līvli (1931-1939) became the development media of Livonian literature, where earlier and new Livonian authors could publish their works between the wars.
It has to be said that poetry has been the most popular genre of fiction in Livonian literature.
It’s understandable, as writing poetry has always been important to the neighbouring peoples of the Livonians as well.
Poems are easy to publish and writing poetry usually takes less time than writing prose.
It was also important to many Livonian authors, who were mostly fisherman and whose day job meant they had to give more attention to oars and nets than pens and paper.
The best known Livonian writer of this period was Kōrli Stalte (1870–1947) – poet, translator, keeper and developer of Livonian culture.
Stalte was also the first chairman of the Livonian Union established in 1923.
He was also the editor of the monthly Līvli (1933–1939) and a translator, who translated the New Testament into Livonian.
Stalte is known the most for his secular and spiritual poems in Livonian.
Stalte started writing before World War I.
In the 1920s and 1930s he was one of the most diligent Livonian poets and the author of the first Livonian book of poetry Līvo lōlõd (Livonian Songs), which was published in Tallinn.
In his work, Stalte focused mostly on the everyday lives of the Livonians and the patriotic and spiritual topics important to them.
However, his poems are still diverse and include simple children’s poems inspired by folklore as well as refined sonnets.
What makes Stalte especially remarkable is that he wrote many of his poems as lyrics for Livonian choirs (he’s also the author of the lyrics of the Livonian anthem).
The same can be said about some other Livonian poets as well.
Singers often believe that they’re singing folk songs, but the lyrics of these songs were actually written by a poet well known to them.
In the end of the 1930s, Stalte compiled the manuscript of a Livonian chrestomathy, which was finally published as a book in 2011, the International Year of Livonian Language and Culture.
The poems of Kōrli Stalte in this book can be considered outstanding examples of Livonian Literature.
The same can be said about the other texts of the chrestomathy written by Stalte, which were initially meant for children, but depict the world so vividly and truthfully in the good and beautiful Livonian language that reading them is a joy to everyone who understands the language.
The stories focus on daily life in Livonian villages and elsewhere.
The first pieces of Livonian prose were published a little earlier, in the third Livonian chrestomathy (1923).
It was compiled by August Skadiņ and the publication of the chrestomathy was supported by the Estonian Temperance Society.
In the book, Skadiņ published several stories about temperance he’d written himself.
The Jemākīel lugdõbrōntõz skūol ja kuod pierāst (Native Language Chrestomathy for Schools and Homes) compiled by Pētõr Damberg was printed in Finland in 1935 and it became one of the most important Livonian publications of its time.
In addition to translations, the chrestomathy also includes poems and stories written by Livonian authors, some of them written by Damberg himself.
Pētõr Damberg was a very important person in Livonian literature and newer culture.
He was active in many fields, wrote and translated poetry into Livonian, collected and translated Livonian folklore, developed written Livonian, advised researchers of Livonian culture and language, participated in the compilation of several dictionaries, which even include a Livonian-Latvian-Esperanto dictionary.
He kept the Livonian culture alive during the Soviet occupation.
In 1930 Pētõr Damberg participated in the publication of the monthly Līvli when studying in the Jelgava Teacher’s Seminary.
The bulk of the works written by Pētõr Damberg is poetry.
His poetry is characterised by a broad use of language and a multi-layered structure.
He has also written down his memoirs, which can be considered one of the finest examples of Livonian prose.
In 1967 Damberg compiled the manuscript of the new Livonian chrestomathy.
It even includes examples of the social realism of the Soviet era, which cannot be found in other Livonian publications.
Between the two world wars, almost all Livonian cultural figures participated in the Livonian literary scene – the radical western Livonian poet Uļi Kīnkamäg (1869–1932), who ended up in a Latvian prison because of his patriotic beliefs that emphasised Livonian nationalism and who was therefore nicknamed the Livonian King in Latvian media, as well as the later chairman of the Livonian Union Didrõk Vālgamō (1884–1968), artist Jāņ Belt (1893–1946) and pastor Edgar Vālgamā (1912–2003) and several scientists, such as Lauri Kettunen and Oskar Loorits.
In terms of the number of readers, the period between wars was the most active time in Livonian literature.
However, as the activities of Pētõr Damberg indicate, the creation of Livonian fiction continued after World War II, although the possibilities of getting anything published were considerably more limited.
The poetry of some authors, such as Alfon Berthold (1900–1993) and Poulīn Kļaviņa (1918–2001), was also published in Estonian scientific publications.
However, the majority of the fiction written at the time never made it past the stage of a manuscript.
When Latvia restored her independence, the publication of Livonian fiction increased as well.
Latvia is our fatherland
Livonians, as many of them as there were, fought for freedom side by side with the Latvians.
This is why we love our fatherland.
Riga on the banks of the great Daugava River is the capital of Latvia.
This is where the government is based.
Ships sail up to Riga along the Daugava River.
They bring goods from foreign lands and take Latvian goods abroad.
Warships also sail there, protecting the coast of Latvia, which is where we, the Livonians, live.
Beach
We live in Livonian villages by the sea.
We see the green forest, blue sea and white sand dunes here every day.
The white sandy beach is the best children’s playground in the world.
You can also pick shells there.
Sometimes, there’s a lot of them on the beach.
Boys carve little boats from pine bark, put masts on them, fasten paper sails to the masts and place them in water.
The wind pushes the boats further from the beach until they reach the shoal, where the waves make them capsize.
If you want, you can also take a dip in the sea.
Adults may cross the second, sometimes also the third shoal when swimming.
Children cannot even get to the second shoal, the water in the gap is too deep.
Water in the second gap is cooler than in the lower gap.
You can see Saaremaa on the other side of the sea on a clear day.
However, you can see the white Saaremaa lighthouse almost every day.
Ships sail on the sea and you can see the fishermen’s boars coming and going.
Fishermen most catch flounder, Baltic herring and sprat from the sea.
Sometimes, there are bigger fish in their nets, such as cod, whitefish, salmon and others.
Game
We go to the beach,
you go to the beach,
all the fishermen in our village go to the beach.
We go to sea,
you go to sea,
all the fishermen in our village go to sea.
We go to the beach,
you go to the beach,
all the fishermen in our village go to the beach.
We go home,
you go home,
all the fishermen in our village go home.
Spring
Spring comes late to the beach.
The reason is the sea ice, which keeps the air cold.
However, when spring arrives at last, it’s beautiful.
Livonians believe that the spring on the beach is the most beautiful in the world.
Willows have catkins.
Apple trees blossom in gardens, surrounded by buzzing bees looking for honey.
Here and there, you can see swallows flying and a stork standing on one leg in its nest. You can hear the sound of a cuckoo and the forest is alive with birdsong.
Rivers and streams are bursting with water and flow joyfully towards the sea.
Fishermen can go to sea and animals can go to pasture again.
In the evening of the day when the cows have been out on the pasture for the first time, water is thrown to the herders to make sure the cows give more milk.
The herders throw water back as well.
Children get involved as well and nobody tells them off when they get their clothes wet on this day.
The sun has left, afraid of the dark winter nights,
It has gone abroad to bring their fishermen some light.
In spring, it’s returned to our home,
On its way, it’s chased away the snow.
The cold of winter and the ice are gone,
As far as you can see, the sea is open now.
Fishermen throw their nets in sea again,
Full of fish, they’re pulled out onto sand.
When they go to the sea, come to the beach, they never forget,
That the sun brought back their work.
Summer
Summer is here when Midsummer Day arrives.
People go to the beach on Midsummer Eve.
Usually, there’s an old boat turned upside down, some dry logs and they’re set on fire.
People sing Midsummer songs, but in Latvian.
Sometimes, you also hear a rare song in the coastal language.
Hard work comes soon after Midsummer Day – it’s time to make hay.
Those whose meadows are far don’t come home every evening and spend the night there.
City people come to the coastal villages for the summer so they can swim in the sea.
This is when the flounder season starts for fishermen.
In the old times, the fishermen pulled the seine ropes out by hand but now, the ropes are much longer and thicker and the flounder seines themselves are much bigger, which is why they’re now pulled out by motorboats.
Sprats also come to the sea in late summer.
Only not many of them are caught during the warm season.
Children are always very excited when they can pick and eat berries in summer.
Strawberries, blueberries and raspberries are all ripe.
Song of a swallow
Listen, children, I will now tell you how the swallow sings:
it sings: “Chirp! Chirp!”
it sings: “Warble!”
it sings: “Tweet, chirp!”
it sings: “Tweet, warble!”
it sings: “Tweet, chirp, tweet, warble,
Tweet, chirp, tweet, warble,
Tweet, chirp, tweet, warble,
Grrrl!”
Autumn
Autumn starts when the crops are ripe and harvested.
The days get shorter and the nights get longer.
The stork has left its nest and the songbirds are gone as well.
They’ve all flown away from us to warmer countries that have no snow and cold.
The forests have gone quiet as well, you can only hear the crows crowing in the evenings, when they fly around in murders, looking for a place where they can spend the night on treetops.
The busiest time for the fishermen has started.
They bring sprats and Baltic herrings back from the sea.
There is enough work for the whole day on the beach.
Once the nets have been cleaned, they’re laid on drying racks and the fishermen – who’ve barely had time grab a bite to eat – soon take them down again so they can be tied up and thrown in the sea again.
The air and the seawater have gone cold, nobody can swim anymore.
When the fingers of net cleaners get cold, they make a fire on the beach to warm their hands and bodies.
People are in a hurry to plough the land, so they’ll be ready for sowing new crops in spring.
When the potatoes have been picked, the land freezes, the water in the sea turns into an icy soup and ice covers the sea, it means that winter has arrived.
Native language
Coastal language, my native language,
Your sound sacred to me.
Those who forget the coastal language,
Forget the words of their mothers.
Coastal people, old and tough,
Spoke the coastal language,
Sang their songs and prayed to God,
In the coastal language.
Coastal language is on our tongues,
As it’s the language that we love.
Let’s be like our fathers:
Livonians, as hard as rock.
Winter
Cold and snow rarely come to the Livonian Coast before Christmas.
Winter starts when Christmas with its fir trees, candles and presents for good children is over.
The weather gets cold and it starts snowing.
Bicycles have been put away for the winter and everyone travels with sleighs and sledges on the snow.
Sometimes, when people go on a visit, they hang a bell on the silver thill and its sound carries far in winter.
Children have to go to school and study hard in winter.
When the schoolwork is done, it’s time to go outside to play, test the depth of the snow drifts and make a snowman.
You can also skate along the valleys and dash down the hills on small sledges, the wind ringing in your ears.
Ice covers the sea and often, you can hear the siren of the icebreaker guiding other ships through the ice.
Ships have to stay put if the winter is really severe, as even the strong icebreaker cannot help them anymore.
Everyone is waiting for spring and the sun, which would melt all the snow and ice.
Fight
Northeast and the sun
Are having a fight, –
Northeastern clouds with snow
Cover up the sun.
The day breaks the clouds,
Sends us sunlight again,
The sun turns the snow
Into flowing water.
Let the northeastern wind blow,
If it takes away the clouds,
The sun can shine again
And claim the win.
The sun melts the snow,
And everything is green again.
The sun becomes the king,
And northeast disappears.
Sandman
The Sandman lived deep in the forest.
He had a big windmill that ground the fine sand of sleep all day long.
In the evening, the Sandman took a big sack of sand and went to the children to make them fall sleep.
He stopped by Karl’s window and looked inside – it’s so late, but the boy is still playing on the floor!
He quickly took a good handful of sand from his sack and sprinkled it in the boy’s eyes through the window.
Now, the boy’s eyelids got heavy and sleep started to tickle the corners of his eyes.
When his mother saw it, she said: “Oh, Sandman, you’re making our Karl fall asleep on the floor.”
Mother picked the boy up and took him to bed.
But the Sandman hurried along to make other children fall asleep as well.
Lullaby
Big mice, small mice,
Bring some sleep to our kids,
Through the chamber,
through the headboard.
What I saw tonight
It was midnight when I woke up.
Everyone was sleeping.
I head someone talking and laughing in the other room.
I climbed out of my bed to see what was going on.
I quietly stood by the door.
And what did I see!
Leena’s doll and mum’s coffee pot were having a wedding.
Both of them were wearing paper roses and the doll was holding on to the coffee pot’s handle.
The floor was filled with guests.
The pot and the pan were making music, everyone else was dancing.
The wood tongs were twirling with the masher and dad’s boots were twisting with the poker.
Everyone was having the time of their lives.
Coffee cups and tea glasses were rolling from one wall to another like balls of yarn.
“Don’t make so much noise!” scolded grandma’s three-legged stool.
“The family will wake up and that’ll be the end of the party.”
But nobody listened to her warning.
They laughed and danced until a coffee cup crashed into the sugar bowl.
The coffee cup’s handle broke off and the sugar bowl fell over.
There was sugar all over the floor.
“What did I tell you!” mumbled grandma’s stool grumpily.
Everyone looked startled and ran back to their places.
I got back in bed.
In the morning, mum thought that rats had made this mess.
Dance, dance, reed
Dance, dance, reed,
Keep on dancing;
Dance with the bristles of flax,
Keep on dancing!
Every day is Sunday,
Every day is a day of dance,
You danced yesterday, you danced today,
Keep on dancing:
You will dance again tomorrow,
Dance, dance, reed.
Abstract.
Valter Lang: Early Finnic-Baltic contacts as evidenced by archaeological and linguistic data.
Long-lasting and intense contacts between Finnic and Baltic tribes resulted in the linguistic and material intertwining of the cultures of these two groups, which belong to two different language families.
This article concentrates on some interesting connections between both cultures, while attempting to explain and illustrate language contacts using the archaeological record.
First, some semantically connected groups of Baltic loanwords in Proto-Finnic will be analysed in order to establish their time and place of borrowing.
Next, the Late Bronze Age contacts will be shown to have been the most intensive. The borrowing of the Finnic name Kalev/Kaleva from Baltic kalvis/kalējs ‘smith’, which first was argued in my earlier paper written in Estonian (Lang 2012), is among the evidence for the intensity of these contacts.
This is followed by a discussion of bronze work and the casting of bronze rings by these smiths or kalevs, and ends with an examination of the use of these rings as offerings and for taxation.
Petri Kallio: Historical Phonology from Proto-Finnic to Proto-Livonian.
This article serves as an attempt to reconstruct the approximate chronological order of the major sound laws between (Late) Proto-Finnic and Proto-Livonian.
A by-product of this study is a reconstruction of the Proto-Livonian phoneme system, the earlier versions of which have been more fragmentary and tentative.
In the end, it is briefly discussed when and where the Livonian proto-language was spoken before its splitting into Courland and Salaca Livonian.
Patrick O’Rourke, Karl Pajusalu: Livonian features in Estonian dialects.
This article presents linguistic innovations which are typical of both Courland and Salaca Livonian and are also known in the neighbouring Estonian dialect areas.
These innovative features are phonological, morphological, and morphosyntactic.
The features are present mainly in western and southwestern Estonia, but also more specifically in areas close to the current western border between Estonia and Latvia.
Broadly spread common features can be mostly explained as inherent innovations of western Finnic when they are not shown to be caused by contacts with Germanic or Baltic languages.
Features which are spread in the immediate vicinity of the former Livonian language area can be classified as a Livonian substrate in sub-dialects of western and insular Estonian.
Kristi Salve: Secretly through Salatsi: place names in Estonian runic songs related to Livonian settlement areas.
The article searches for an answer to the question whether Estonian runic songs contain references to Livonians.
Using the materials from the database of Estonian runic songs, the article observes some names of countries, rivers and towns.
The name of Courland proved to be extremely popular; it appears, however, in very different contexts.
Tuuli Tuisk: Main features of the Livonian sound system and pronunciation.
The aim of this article is to give an overview of the Livonian sound system and pronunciation.
Regarding Livonian dialectal variation, the main difference is between East and West Livonian, while Central Livonian forms a transition area.
The basis of the Livonian written language is the East Courland dialect.
This article focuses on standard pronunciation, with some discussion of variation.
Vowels and consonants are treated separately.
In addition, Livonian prosodic features are discussed.
Livonian stands out as being a Finnic language that has been influenced by the Baltic language, Latvian.
Unlike many other Finnic languages, Livonian has voiced stops and fri catives, which can occur as long geminates.
There is a large number of short and long monophthongs, diphthongs, and triphthongs in Livonian.
Tiit-Rein Viitso: The essive in Livonian.
In Livonian, there is a small set of word forms denoting locality or time and answering the questions where? and when?, and can be considered forms of the essive case on the basis of their case endings just as similar forms in other Finnic languages.
The article studies these forms and related forms of the lative, sublative, and excessive case forms, answering the questions to where? to when?, and from where? from when?, and their history.
In addition, word forms formally identical with the dative forms but used as adverbials of state are as forms of essive extracted from the dative, and their usage types are identified.
Valts Ernštreits: Methods for expanding the Livonian lexicon.
This article explores opportunities for expanding the vocabulary of Livonian through compounds, borrowings, derived words, and calques.
It is clear that these methods have been effectively used already throughout the entire period of development of the modern Livonian literary language and, therefore, specific traditions have evolved in forming neologisms in Livonian.
So, in forming compounds, one has to pay special attention to whether the singular or plural form is used for each component, the historical genitive is used in select types of compounds, or one or both components must be declined.
Borrowings in Livonian are largely connected with internationalisms borrowed through Latvian, but adapted to fit with the unique demands of Livonian pronunciation and morphology.
Derivation using suffixes is quite productive, while derivation using prefixes is distinctly limited, despite views to the contrary which are sometimes encountered.
Many new concepts have actively entered Livonian through the use of calques.
Word formation in Livonian is still a little studied topic where more in depth studies are needed; however, already existing research into the expansion of the Livonian lexicon ensures the existence of a rich source of material for future study in this area.
Renāte Blumberga: The Livonian language as used in letters in the 1930s: a view into the correspondence of the editors of “Līvli”.
Using vocabulary examples from the letters of the only two editors of the 1930s Livonian language newspaper “Līvli”, this article shows that it is possible to find new words in sources which have been little utilized up until now in linguistic studies with which it is possible to supplement the Livonian lexicon.
The vocabulary examples show the types of new words and borrowing that the “Līvli” editors put to use in their correspondence and whether these reflect forms found in the 2012 “Livonian-Estonian-Latvian dictionary”, which is the largest project devoted to the Livonian language undertaken in recent times.
A brief analysis is provided on the basis of these examples showing whether the spelling of these words and their grouping by declension type is done in a consistent manner or whether changes are necessary in this respect.
It is concluded that in the “Livonian-Estonian-Latvian dictionary” there is a considerable diversity in declension types in need of being simplified for the following groups of borrowed words: 1) nouns ending in Latvian with -āris, -ārs and in Livonian with -ār; 2) nouns ending in Latvian with -ors and in Livonian with -or, -ōr; 3) nouns ending in Latvian with -āls, -āle, -ālis and in Livonian with -al, -āl, 4) adjectives ending in Latvian with -āls and in Livonian with -āl.
Likewise, it is concluded that in newly formed words, especially borrowed international words, word formation principles are not followed consistently.
Additionally, examples of possible new words, which could be added to the dictionary of the Livonian literary language, are provided in this article.
Christopher Moseley: Revitalizing a community language: Livonian and other community languages.
The present paper compares efforts to revive the spoken use of two European languages which have fallen into disuse: Cornish, spoken in the southwest of England, and Livonian in Latvia.
Different approaches have been taken in encouraging heritage learners to use the languages again, but there are points in common, and each has something to learn from the other.
The work of the Cornish Language Partnership in organizing and encouraging Cornish learners is compared with the courses run by the branch of the Livonian Association in Kolka, Kurzeme.
Constitutional Committee gathered many – it was formed by 26 deputies of the Constitutional Assembly.
It was clear that for such a many­headed group execution of the particular, practical intellectual work would be hard.
Therefore it was decided to split it into two Sub­Committees: one that would develop the state political system project, and the second that would develop the declaration of civil freedom and rights.
Thus in the first Sub­Committee 13 deputies united, and the energetic Fēliks Cielēns (born in 1888, in Vidzeme side of Riga County, died in 1964) was elected as its Head.
While studying in Paris he had researched the constitutional rights and the Western parliamentarism. 
Already in 1915, with the thought of the political autonomy of Latvia in mind, published his basic principles of state arrangement.
Fēlikss Cielēns had obtained solid education and amassed political work experience: from 1906 to 1910 he studied the law at the University of Petersburg, from 1912 to 1913 at the University of Paris, and from 1904 had devotedly taken part in the revolutionary movement.
As in 1906 the court martial, held on a battlefield, sentenced him to death penalty by default, he was forced to emigrate and to work in Brussels, Paris, Switzerland for years, to produce materials for the newspaper “Cīņa” and for other social democratic and democratic publications.
But during the fateful period for Latvia he was present at the first row of the People’s Council, the Constitutional Assembly, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Saeima, the foreign missions and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Sub­Committee led by him proposed such basic settings as the state central authority – parliament and its election, state president and chairman of the parliament, the cabinet of ministers, prime minister and ministers, judges, state controller, referendums, amendments to the Constitution.
In September 1921, Jānis Purgalis (born in 1868, in Valka County, died in 1934) along with M. Skujenieks submitted extended review and analyses by paragraphs.
He had studied the law at the University of Moscow (1892­1896), became sworn advocate, elected the Deputy Chairman of Riga Latvian Society, Deputy Chairman of Riga City Council, active organizer of householders in Riga and delegate of Latvian householders in the forums for householders in Holland, Austria, Germany and Italy.
After Constitutional Assembly – Deputy of the 1st Saeima.
In Sub­Committees, as well as in Committees also other deputies of the Constitutional Assembly took active part – Arveds Bergs, Pauls Kalniņš, Pauls Šīmanis, Gustavs Zemgals, Alberts Kviesis, Kārlis Ulmanis, Valērija Seile, Francis Kemps, Juris Pabērzs, Oto Nonācs, Fricis Menders, as well as the authoritative lecturers of the University of Latvia – state lawyer Kārlis Di lers, economists, linguists and many others.
Arveds Bergs (born in 1875, in Riga) – lawyer and well­known social worker, graduate of Terbata University, Faculty of Law and right after the University worked in Petersburg District Court and Judicial Panel, then in the Riga Latvian Society, the actual head of “Baltijas Vēstnesis”, “Dzimtenes Vēstnesis” and other publications, organizer of the progressive intelligence, author of significant publications about the international status of Latvia and about Russia in French, German, English and Russian languages.

“...Nation of Latvia has been able to form its democratic Constitution, to develop and to protect it, and we can be sure that the nation will know, how to continue this process also further on – in the next decades and centenaries of the Republic of Latvia.”
Undoubtedly: the Constitution of Latvia was formed by the highest hallmark of Latvian intelligence, people representing the rich culture.
Among them – our great intellectual workers, the ideological leaders of the statehood of Latvia throughout many years: Rainis and Aspazija, Kārlis Skalbe, Francis Trasuns, Andrejs Kurcijs and many others.
Rainis – Jānis Pliekšāns (born in 1865, in Jēkabpils County) – Latvian intellectual worker representing the highest hallmark, graduate of the University of Petersburg, Faculty of Law (1888), worked as an advocate and notary in various places, involved in the ideological movement of the Latvian intellectuals “The New Stream” at the end of the century, arrested, deported to non­voluntary settlement in Northern Russia (1899­1903), one of the inspirers of the 1905 Revolution, together with his wife Aspazija (since 1897) exiled (1905­1920) to Switzerland, fostered the idea of the statehood of Latvia and strived to promote the intellectual development of the nation, education, democracy throughout his life, continuously published in the newspapers of Switzerland and Germany writing about Latvia and Latvians, provided outstanding investment in the Latvian poetry and dramaturgy of symbolic direction, in 1919 delightfully welcomes the founding of the country of Latvia: “Ave, free Latvia!” In 1920 Rainis and Aspazija, both return to Riga very inspired and are elected to the Constitutional Assembly and the Saeima, becomes Director of the Daile Theatre (1920­1921), Director of the National Theatre (1921­1925), Minister of Education (1926­1928).

In spring 1920, from Zurich through Warsaw and Daugavpils both poets return to Riga on 10 April and are greeted by the demonstrations of the people.
And a week later are elected as Deputies to the Constitutional Assembly.
In the Constitutional Assembly the poets are vividly, although probably subjectively depicted by another Deputy, a member of the party Fēlikss Cielēns, he describes Rainis’s insecurity as an orator in the department, and Aspazija, who has given address only a few times, but whose voice “was loud and clear, her language was fluent; no sentiment could be observed in her speech, no mannered, lyrical adornments.
She spoke as a true fighter and was not shy to defeat the opponent using irony...”

Rainis concludes: “Francis Trasuns was the first resident of Latgale, who searched and found a way towards understanding between two separated parts of our nation.” And the State President Jānis Čakste after Francis Trasuns had passed away in April 1926 said: “Francis Trasuns placed the third star – Latgale – in the coat of arms of our Latvia.” ...This was the resident of Latgale – Chairman of Latgale Provisional Land Council (1917­1918), Member of Latvian People’s Council, Deputy of the Constitutional Assembly, the 1st and the 2nd Saeima.

But in the autumn of 1944 he was forced to leave his home in the one of the last boats of refugees and travel to the other coast of the Baltic Sea – to Sweden, where in the spring of 1945 he died in Stockholm.
...And so: the mentioned, as well as many others (not to declare that all hundred and fifty five) Deputies of the Constitutional Assembly developed and adopted the Basic Law of the Republic of Latvia – the Constitution ...
Meanwhile the Peace Treaty was signed in Riga between Latvia and Russia and the Fight for Freedom ended (11 August 1920), the vitally important Law of the Agrarian Reform was adopted (in parts, 16 September 1920 – 3 May 1922), in Bulduri Conference of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Finland takes place (with the participation of representatives of Ukraine and Belarus) about the founding of the Baltic Entente (6 August – 6 September 1920), the population census is executed, which provides the results of 1.6 million residents in Latvia, the countries of Entente declare the Republic of Latvia de jure (26 January 1921), Latvia becomes the member of the League of Nations (22 September 1921), Latvia introduces its own money (3 August 1922: LVL 1 – 0,2903226 grams of pure gold), elections of the 1st Saiema take place (7/8 October 1922), the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia comes into force, the 1st Saeima meets for the first session (7 November 1922), the first State President of the Republic of Latvia Jānis Čakste is elected (14 November 1922)...
When closing the Constitutional Assembly Jānis Čakste admits: “...We have completed our work.
We cannot judge the quality of our own work, let the nation judge it as well as the future generations.
(..)The first statutory representatives of the nation of Latvia have proved themselves as capable of working parliamentary work, and this work has shown results.
The idea of the country of Latvia, awareness about the necessity of the country of Latvia has deeply strengthened its positions in the nation.
I think that now we could not find a single person, who would be against this idea of the country of Latvia.
The new Latvia, at the foundation of which we have been working for two years, will develop, will flourish and thrive for our future generations.”
But on 7 November 1922 by the sound of cannon fireworks and opening of the first Saeima, Jānis Čakste evaluates the results even more historically: “Right now the new State Constitution of Latvia comes into force in the country of Latvia.
This new Constitution introduces a new political system in Latvia, it partially creates new authorities and more precisely defines the functions of the existing, as well as the new institutions.
From that moment on, the new constitution is the basis on which our governing bodies and leaders can act better and more fully than has hitherto been possible.
We all hope and are confident that this new constitution will help us to make Latvia lawful and legal at the same time, while at the same time ensuring the well-being and order of the people.
Let this new constitution make Latvia happy and strong! ”
The contribution of people who are convinced of the idea of Latvian statehood has remained in the transcripts and the text of the Constitution, which is a precious legacy for us.
It is the basis of a democratic, considered and harmonious state and the lives of its citizens.
