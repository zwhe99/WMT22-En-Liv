Missed Out on Shiba Inu?
EverGrow Might Be The Next Big Crypto To Explode in 2022
Shiba Inu is the latest meme-crypto to go viral and despite being down almost 60% from it's all-time high, the market cap still stands at an eye-watering $20 billion, making it the 12th biggest crypto in the world by valuation.
A $100 investment at launch would be worth over $2 million today!
Many are no doubt kicking themselves for missing out on such gains, but the reality is that a bet on Shiba Inu was a pure gamble.
Shiba's run was a combination of some very smart marketing and a whole lot of hype, that led droves of investors, with FOMO (fear of missing out) to pile into the meme-coin.
Even the name itself, which was a homage to Elon Musk backed Dogecoin, was all part of the design.
In reality, Shiba Inu offers no tangible utility or value, with seemingly little effort to do so in the future.
Being on the Ethereum blockchain, there would've been plenty of opportunity for development had the team behind Shiba Inu been motivated to do so.
There are, however, several cryptocurrencies that are working to rise above the pack, and back their popularity with real utility and fundamental value.
Just 10 weeks ago, EverGrow Coin ($EGC) was launched by a team of experienced finance, blockchain and marketing experts.
One ground-breaking element of their project is the fact the token pays a stable currency to holders.
In the short time since launch, holders of EverGrow Coin have received over $30 million of binance-pegged USD rewards - a stable, regulated currency pegged 1-to-1 with the USD.
The project currently has 110,000 holders according to BSCScan.
With their revolutionary contract, EverGrow Coin quickly grew to over $1 billion in market-cap, but then a major data error on CoinMarketCap, just weeks into the launch, caused mass panic amongst investors.
With such a new project, trust can take time to build, and this panic was exploited by a series of articles, rumoured to have been paid for by rivals of the project, using the incorrect data to try to draw EverGrow investors away from the project.
Over the next month, the errors remained unfixed, and EverGrow sunk to below $300 million in valuation.
Yesterday, CoinMarket Cap placed an alert on EverGrow's page, confirming that the data error had been fixed.
The price has now stabilised, and signs of returning confidence saw an increase of 22% from the recent lows.
However, EverGrow still remains well below the highs achieved before this error.
EverGrow is very different from Shiba Inu.
In addition to the obvious benefits of USD rewards, the team behind the project have already launched a SWAP dApp on their website, have recently revealed the upcoming release of a Crypto Wallet, promising to surpass the features offered by Trust Wallet or Safemoon Wallet, and have a whole suite of utilities, from content creation platform to NFT Market Place & Lending, designed to bring continuous value to investors.
Is EverGrow Coin the next Shiba Inu?
With Shiba Inu, offering little to no utility, valued at around 66 times that of EverGrow Coin, there is a clear argument for an innovative and ground-breaking project like EverGrow to see some serious upside from their current low market cap.
If the team continues to impress the crypto community with their innovation and transparency and can shake off the fear spread among investors by the CoinMarketCap errors, there is a good chance EverGrow Coin could be one of the top cryptos to invest in for 2022.

Warning of stormy weather as strong winds present 'danger to life'
Storm force winds are set to batter northern parts of Scotland with disruption to travel, especially ferry services, expected.
The northwest, Shetland and Orkney will face gusts of up to 85mph overnight on Sunday into Monday morning.
The Hebrides, and western coast of the Highlands and parts of Argyll and Bute have been warned to be prepared for flying debris presenting a "danger to life" and causing damage to buildings.
Experts are warning that the bad weather could lead to power cuts, road and bridge closures, and cancellations to air and ferry services.
It follows two named storms, Arwen and Barra, that brought widespread disruption to large parts of the country.
More than 100,000 homes had their power cut off by the extreme damage wrought by Storm Arwen on November 26 and 27.
Storm Barra disrupted supplies to around 10,000 just 11 days later on December 7.

The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for wind with the first coming into force from 9pm on Sunday covering the Western Isles, and parts of the Highlands and Argyll and Bute.
"Within this area there is the potential of gusts reaching 80-85mph causing disruption to ferries and also some damage and power cuts," Philip said.
A further warning comes into effect at midnight on Sunday covering Orkney and Shetland.
"This warning lasts until midday Monday as the centre of the low pressure system moves close to the Northern Isles, again bringing gusts of 80-85mph along coasts and locally in excess of 90mph in some areas," Philip said.
"It is very fast moving though, so will clear away by Monday afternoon, with things beginning to ease and calm by lunchtime.
For the rest of the week things will continue to settle ahead of next weekend."

Water heater temp and bath issue.
My water heater is set pretty low.
It’s a small tank in a closet (I live in an old pre-war apartment).
Question is, it does fill the bathtub up all the way without going cold.
If I only bathe once a week (but shower every 2 days or so) and the heater has enough water for quick showers, is it worth turning up the heat for the once a week bath?
Or would I save more electricity heating up my stock pot on the stove and adding it to the bath once the water heater is emptied?
Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice!
I turned up the heat just a little and it did the trick.
The comment about boiling being inefficient is probably correct bc even though the water heater is running continuously, that thing has SO MUCH insulation.

Long queues for Banksy's shirts supporting statue-toppling protesters
Crowds desperate to buy shirts designed by the mysterious street artist Banksy have been seen in Bristol, UK.
They were released to support protesters on trial for toppling a slave trader statue during a Black Lives Matter march.
Banksy designed the limited edition "souvenir shirts" to mark the trial of four people charged with damaging a controversial statue in Bristol last year.
"All proceeds to the defendants so they can go for a pint," the artist wrote on Instagram.
Sold for £25 ($33) plus VAT and limited to only one item per person at several shops, the shirt has been in such demand that people queued around blocks to get it.
An almost two-minute long video posted on Twitter shows an endless line of customers.
UK media reported that "thousands" were eager to raise cash for the protesters by purchasing the gray T-shirt, which depicts an empty plinth with "Bristol" written above it.
It refers to a toppled bronze memorial to the 17th century merchant Edward Colston, who was involved in the transatlantic slave trade.
The activists, known as the "Colston Four," are facing a trial at Bristol Crown Court next week, charged with inflicting criminal damage to a monument belonging to the city council.
The men - who have all pleaded not guilty - are accused of sinking the statue "without lawful excuse."
Praised by some for leaving money to various charitable causes after his death, the controversial trader's statue was attacked in June 2020, when a protest supporting the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement was happening in the city.
The damaged plinth and graffitied statue was later recovered by the city council from Bristol Harbour, where it was thrown during the unrest, and re-emerged as a local museum exhibit, alongside a curated selection of BLM posters from the march.
A sculpture of a BLM protester was erected on the empty plinth previously occupied by Colston.

Molecular Diagnosis Test Can Detect Omicron Variant In 20 Minutes: Report
Korean researchers have developed molecular diagnostics technology that can detect Omicron variants.
The technology development has been currently completed, and it is expected to take time for commercialization.
POSTECH announced on the 10th that a research team led by Professor Lee Jung-wook of the Department of Chemical Engineering has developed molecular diagnostic technology that can detect the Omicron variant in just 20-30 minutes and will publish the results online.
Omicron is a variant in which 26-32 mutations in the spike, which is used to infect cells by the COVID-19 virus.
According to the research team, molecular diagnostics technology can distinguish mutations at the single-nucleotide base, so it can detect "Stealth Omicron," which are difficult to be detected by PCR tests.
Currently, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using three methods to detect COVID-19 variants: whole-genome analysis, target DNA (mutations such as spike protein) analysis, and PCR test.
In the case of the Delta variant, it can be detected by the current PCR test, but Omicron cannot.
The newly developed technology this time is not a sequencing method that reads DNA or RNA sequences, but the molecular diagnostic technology.
The existing technology screens only specific areas of the virus, but the molecular diagnostic technology was designed to cause nucleic acid-binding reactions only when the COVID-19 RNA exists, enabling rapid detection.
According to Professor Lee, Omicron has a strong signal for N genes in PCR tests but has a weak signal for S genes.
In the case of "Stealth Omicron," both N and S genes confirmed positive, making it difficult to distinguish from other variants.
The molecular diagnostic technology works in different mechanisms from PCR, detecting the Omicron variant efficiently.
Unlike conventional technology that generally processes up to 96 samples per device, the new technology can process more than 125 in 30 minutes (more than 250 samples per hour).
In addition, this technology does not need specialized equipment, thus can make diagnostic kits simply and easily.
As the method can develop the diagnosis kit in 4 days, it is expected to respond quickly even if a new variant or virus occurs in the future.
"I hope the disclosure of this technology will help us return to normal daily life as soon as possible," said Professor Lee.
We will try to quickly diagnose and respond to new variants that may come out after COVID-19.
This technology is currently before commercialization.
However, it can be used as an auxiliary in current situations where the PCR test for Omicron has not been developed.
Professor Lee said, "I think this technology will be close to commercialization in the second half of next year after clinical trials.
The reason why I disclose the technology is to share it with others to develop better technologies for overcoming COVID-19 and to allow underdeveloped countries also analyze COVID-19 variants."

Hey r/Military!
I am from a country where military duty is mandatory and I am just wondering how's it like for other countries.
Hello everyone!
I am from Estonia, where I am part of the National Defense Force.
Here military service is mandatory for all men from the ages of 16-29.
You have to complete either 8 or 11 months of training after which you are sent to the "reserve" unit until you turn 60.
In that time, the Defense Force is eligible to demand you take part in some military exercises once or twice a year for approx 2 weeks per year.
However, you are not mandated to go on a foreign mission.
If you want to do that, you have to join the "scouts battalion" where you will be a professional military dude with pay and such.
I am just wondering how is it for other countries?
If you join the military in, for example, the USA or the UK, then are you mandated to go fight in another country?
What do you guys think about mandatory military service?
During training when I was in Tapa 2018-2019, there were also units from the UK, US, France, Belgium, Denmark and Canada.
Unfortunately though, we really didn't have much time to socialize and I didn't get to ask those guys in person what it's like for them to serve in their country's military.

Liz Truss pledges another £75m in aid to Afghanistan at G7 meeting
A further £75 million in aid is to be given to Afghanistan by the UK to help address its worsening humanitarian situation, Liz Truss has announced.
The Foreign Secretary said the commitment would help save lives and "support stability in the region."
It follows discussions among G7 foreign ministers in Liverpool on Saturday about what co-ordinated action can be taken in Afghanistan, along with how to engage with the Taliban rulers.
The militant group stormed Kabul in a lightning advance in August, as 20 years of occupation of the central Asian country was brought to a close with a hurried allied withdrawal.
Ms Truss said: "The UK is providing vital humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan this winter.
The funds announced today will save lives, protect women and girls and support stability in the region.
We are determined to do all we can for the people of Afghanistan."
The additional financial support will bring the UK's commitment to Afghanistan to £286 million this year.
It will be used to provide support for victims of gender-based violence and to fund essential child protection services.
The United Nations and aid agencies will prioritise those most at risk including households headed by women and disabled people, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said (FCDO).
Officials said no funding would go directly through the Taliban, instead being funnelled through the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, World Food Programme (WFP) and other organisations.
The WFP will receive £34 million of the funding announced on Sunday.
David Beasley, the organisation's executive director, said the donation would "help us save many lives."
"What we are seeing on the ground is heart-breaking - 23 million people are facing severe hunger in a country crippled by drought, conflict and an economic crisis," he said.
"Women and children are bearing the brunt of this suffering and, as the harsh winter descends, more and more are slipping into malnutrition and starvation each day."
This week the UN's humanitarian chief warned that Afghanistan's economic collapse was "happening before our eyes" and urged the international community to take action to stop "the freefall" before it leads to more deaths.
Martin Griffiths said: "It's getting more and more dire by the week."
The funding announcement comes after ministers this week faced awkward questions about the Afghan withdrawal effort following a whistleblower's evidence to MPs.
Raphael Marshall, who worked for the Foreign Office during Operation Pitting, claimed just 5% of Afghan nationals who applied to flee under one UK scheme received help as a result of the "dysfunctional" and "chaotic" handling of the situation.
Mr Marshall told the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee that some of those hoping to escape were murdered after being left behind in Kabul.
He also claimed Boris Johnson requested that "considerable capacity" was made available to evacuate animals from a shelter run by former Royal Marine Paul "Pen" Farthing, putting the lives of troops at risk to help aid their departure on a privately funded plane.
The Prime Minister has called the claims "complete nonsense."
At the Museum of Liverpool on Sunday, Ms Truss will have discussions with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, who are attending the G7 gathering for the first time - most of them virtually.
The Foreign Secretary will stress the importance of working with south-east Asia's "economies of the future" to tackle the current challenges facing the West, the FCDO said.
The invitation to Asian ministers comes after the UK's integrated review on foreign policy announced in March a "tilt" towards the Indo-Pacific, in a move seen as aiming to counter China's growing influence in the region.

Dallas Cowboys bring benches to Washington, rivalry heats up
The visiting sideline at Washington has a familiar home look for the Dallas Cowboys.
After getting word from other teams that the sideline benches at FedEx Field were in major need of an upgrade, the Cowboys brought their own for this showdown game.
When they arrived at the stadium Sunday, they were already decked out in Cowboys logos and wordmarks.
The Cowboys heard from the Seahawks, who recently played against Washington on a Monday night and had complaints that the heated benches were malfunctioning.
Earlier in the week, Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott actually commented about the benefits of playing outdoors in colder games, because of the heated benches are beneficial to his knee injury.
The Cowboys just made sure Zeke and his teammates got that opportunity.
This move is just the latest twist in the Dallas-Washington rivalry, one that got juiced up even more this week when Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy predicted a win for his team, prompting some fireworks back and forth with Washington's Ron Rivera and players.
Washington has beaten the Cowboys in consecutive matchups.
It has been more than 30 years since it has defeated Dallas in three straight meetings (1986-88).
Cowboys fans made up more than half of the crowd at FedEx field, which was evident based on the blue and white jerseys in the stands.
Owner Jerry Jones foreshadowed that earlier this week when he said on 105.3 FM in Dallas, "We have always sold more Cowboys' hats, caps, T-shirts.
We've always had our greatest fan support positive coming from Washington, that's outside the Dallas area.
Outside the Texas area, Washington is where we have the most support of all when it comes to all the things you might count."

> Decoupling will need them to make sure their apps work on all different iOS versions.
This isn't even necessarily true.
Just put a cap on the versions of iOS that the app supports and only push out updates for devices with the latest compatible versions of iOS.
That's how most apps work now.
> Also, since Apple can release new iOS and macOS versions frequently.
Isn't the problem that this still isn't frequently enough?
It also makes for some terrible UX.
Even if Apple upped the rate of OS updates to account for minor bug fixes in a handful of apps, why does the user need to perform *a full OS upgrade* every time?
And what does "the developers can be confident that their patch/feature will get pushed out in the new release" even mean?
> This is in contrast to Google.
Google had to delink because there were a lot of Android versions in the wild, each with a huge market share.
I can say without a doubt that if Android versions on phones were consistent like iOS, Google would never have done the releases with OS releases for these apps.
That's a bold claim, but either way it still doesn't explain how bundling app updates as OS updates is "better" for the developers, or the end user.

South Africa Pays Tribute to Last Apartheid Leader De Klerk
South Africa on Sunday paid an official tribute to FW de Klerk, the final president of white rule, who freed Nelson Mandela from prison and steered the country from apartheid to democracy.
De Klerk died on November 11 aged 85 following a battle with cancer.
Four days of national mourning were declared in his honor.
He served as president from 1989 to 1994 and is remembered most for leading South Africa's transition from white-minority rule to the first multi-racial elections in 1994.
De Klerk also shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993 after freeing him from prison in 1990.
Mandela then became South Africa's first black president after his African National Congress party won the 1994 election.
President Cyril Ramaphosa attended Cape Town's Protestant Groote Kerk - one of South Africa's oldest churches - on Sunday morning to deliver a eulogy in De Klerk's honor.
"He was often misunderstood due to his over-correctness," De Klerk's widow Elita Georgiadis told around 200 attendees.
I shall never forget this man who mesmerized me, who made me want to help him achieve this huge task ahead of him.
A private mass and the national anthem preceded the ceremony, which featured a portrait of De Klerk between two candles and a choir decorated with white flowers.
Despite a positive reputation abroad, De Klerk divided opinion in South Africa and his death prompted mixed reactions.
Critics say he remains inseparable from apartheid-era crimes and could have been held accountable for them had he lived longer.
De Klerk represented the National Party, which in 1948 formally established apartheid's racial segregation and disenfranchisement of South Africa's non-white majority.
Outside the church, a small group of protesters held signs saying, "Justice denied" and "Justice for apartheid victims" and were swiftly led away by police.
The surrounding area was closed to traffic and placed under high security.
Comments in his final years also tarnished De Klerk's image amid criticism for his failure to apologize officially for the crimes of apartheid.
In 2020, he denied apartheid was a crime against humanity before retracting the statement and apologizing.
De Klerk's foundation issued a posthumous video apologizing "for the pain, hurt, indignity and damage that apartheid has done" to South Africa's non-white populations.

France reacts to rival offer of US frigates to Greece
The defense ministries of France and Greece have both confirmed that a competing offer from the US will have no impact on an already "signed" and "final" multibillion deal to purchase French Belharra frigates.
France's Ministry of Armed Forces stated on Saturday that a defense contract with Athens had already been "initialled a few days ago," before the US State Department announced its approval of a potential sale of American frigates.
Since we have been in discussion with the Greeks, the American offer is no longer on the table...
We also signed the contract with the Greeks.
Greece's Defense Ministry also confirmed that the deal with Paris was "final," since it had been negotiated at the "highest level possible" and "personally announced" by the Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis.
The finalized contracts are allegedly expected to be ratified by the Greek Parliament "soon."
The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Friday it had approved the sale for $6.9 billion of four Lockheed Martin combat frigates, and a separate $2.5 billion program to upgrade Greece's MEKO class frigates.
The announcement triggered some concerns over the Athens-Paris agreement, especially after a long-existing submarine construction "deal of the century" between France and Australia was abruptly tanked by a bombshell AUKUS pact in September, without any prior warning.
Outraged Paris accused Washington and Canberra of a "stab in the back," while just two weeks later Macron took the stage with the Greek PM to personally announce the sale of at least three French warships to Athens for around $3.5 billion, saying it was time to "stop being naive" while touting the new deal as a sign of "Europe's strategic autonomy and sovereignty."
This time around, according to the French military, the US "had warned us that this announcement was going to come out" and that Americans allegedly had "no inclination to go further" with an actual sale of their frigates.

This year's trend for a second Christmas tree in the bedroom sends sales of smaller spruces soaring
Got just the one Christmas tree?
Then you could be behind the times.
This year's trend is for a second tree in the bedroom, and it has sent sales of smaller spruces soaring.
More than a quarter of British homes now boast two festive firs, experts say - and it could be more than a status symbol.
Both the soothing green colour and the pine aroma are said to be good for mental health and sleep cycles - while even fake trees can help evoke a feeling of nostalgia.
Other families get two trees so children can decorate one as gaudily as they like, providing a place for any home-made masterpieces, while leaving a more elegantly garlanded fir on more prominent display to impress the neighbours.
Among those buying into the trend, which started in the US, are Carole Middleton, mother of the Duchess of Cambridge, who gets a second tree for grandchildren George, Louis and Charlotte at her home in Bucklebury, West Berkshire.
Last week, she posted on Instagram: "Once again this year we plan to have two Christmas trees: one for the children to decorate and one which I do myself."
British Garden Centres said sales of smaller trees are up 50 per cent this year across its 58 sites.
Director Boyd Douglas-Davies, who is also president of the Horticulture Trades Association, said: "People are trading up from a plant in the bedroom and putting in beautifully decorated trees."
Fellow garden centre chain Squire's reports that 30 per cent of their customers plan on having at least two trees - and more than one in ten intend to have three or more.
Chairman Sarah Squire said: "They give a bedroom a lovely, calming scent that is the perfect aid for a good night's sleep."
Just as bedroom plants have been known to help mental health and purify the air, trees are also said to aid slumber.
Sleep expert Carl Walsh said: "Our brains collect information from our surroundings and this translates into signals releasing hormones in response.
In this instance melatonin and cortisol are the hormones that control your sleep cycle and put your body into a sleepy state."
He added that a bedroom tree could also transport people back to a more carefree and youthful era.
"Christmas can be a pretty stressful time.
A bedroom tree takes people back to their childhood when they had no responsibilities and can forget about stressful things.
That is always good for sleep."

Russia warned of 'consequences' if Ukraine attacked
The Group of Seven has warned Russia of massive consequences and severe costs if President Vladimir Putin attacks Ukraine, according to a draft statement.
US intelligence assesses that Russia could be planning a multi-front offensive on Ukraine as early as next year, involving up to 175,000 troops.
The Kremlin denies it plans to invade and says the West is gripped by Russophobia.
Moscow says the expansion of NATO threatens Russia and has contravened assurances given to it as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
At a meeting in the northern English city Liverpool, the G7 delegates said they were united in their condemnation of Russia's military build-up near Ukraine and they called on Moscow to de-escalate.
"Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe cost," the draft statement said, confirmed by G7 sources.
"We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future," the draft said.
For Moscow, the growing NATO embrace of a neighbouring former Soviet republic - and what it sees as the nightmare possibility of alliance missiles in Ukraine targeted against Russia - is a "red line" it will not allow to be crossed.
Mr Putin has demanded legally binding security guarantees that NATO will not expand further east or place its weapons close to Russian territory; Washington has repeatedly said no country can veto Ukraine's NATO hopes.
In 2014, Russia seized the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine, prompting the West to slap sanctions on Russia.
The Kremlin said today that Mr Putin told US President Joe Biden that Russian troops posed no threat and that Moscow was being demonised for moving troops around its own territory.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were very serious conceptual differences between Russia and the United States on Moscow's "red lines."
The G7 comprises Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and the United States, and includes a representative from the European Union.
"We call on Russia to de-escalate, pursue diplomatic channels and abide by its international commitments on transparency of military activities," the G7 said in the draft.
"We reconfirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy Format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the draft said.
China's Xi and Russia's Putin dominate the G7
Pope calls for 'serious international dialogue' to defuse Ukraine tensions
Pope Francis, in his first comments on the tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine, today called for serious international dialogue to resolve tensions and urged both sides to avoid an armed conflict.
He said he was praying for "dear Ukraine, for all its churches and religious communities and for all of its people, so that tensions there are resolved through a serious international dialogue and not with weapons."
Weapons are not the path to take.
May this Christmas bring peace to Ukraine," the pope told thousands of people in St Peter's Square for his noon blessing and address.
Ukraine is predominantly Orthodox Christian, with Catholics of either the Latin Rite or Byzantine rite making up about 10% of the population in the former Soviet republic.
Separately, Mr Biden has said he told Mr Putin that Russia would pay "a terrible price" and face devastating economic consequences if it invaded Ukraine.

Time is running out for Iran nuclear deal, Germany says
Germany's foreign minister warned on Saturday that time was running out to find a way to revive a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran, speaking after meetings with her counterparts from G7 countries.
Talks have resumed in Vienna to try to revive the nuclear pact, with both sides trying to gauge the prospects of success after the latest exchanges in the stop-start negotiations.
"Time is running out," German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters in Liverpool, England where G7 foreign ministers are meeting.
It has shown in the last days that we do not have any progress.
Baerbock said Iran had resumed the talks with a position that set the negotiations back six months.
The current round of talks in Vienna follow a pause of five months after the election of a hardline anti-Westerner as Iran's president, Ebrahim Raisi.
Earlier, U.S. officials said Secretary of State Antony Blinken had held a "productive" meeting with counterparts from Britain, Germany and France on Friday, discussing the way forward for the Iran talks.
A senior State Department official said there was an "intense" conversation among the G7 countries, which were united in their position on the nuclear talks.
"The statement will also be strong on the importance of getting Iran back to the table and that it is possible to conclude a deal but that the time is shrinking, so we're united in that," the official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity, said.
The official added that U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley was heading back to Vienna for talks.
Iranian officials have previously said they were sticking to their tough stance.
Under the original nuclear deal, abandoned in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump, Iran limited its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions.
The West fears the program would be used to develop weapons, something Tehran denies.
Raisi said on Saturday that Tehran was serious in its nuclear talks in Vienna, the official IRNA news agency reported.
The indirect U.S.-Iranian talks, in which diplomats from France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China shuttle between them because Tehran refuses direct contact with Washington, aim to get both sides to resume full compliance with the accord.
The G7 meeting which is expected to result in a joint call for Iran to moderate its nuclear program and grasp the opportunity of the Vienna talks.

French fishermen threaten to disrupt British imports in post-Brexit fishing row
French fishermen have threatened to disrupt British imports in an attempt to press London for more licenses as tensions escalate between France and the UK over post-Brexit fishing rights.
The threat was made on Saturday a few hours after Britain agreed to issue another 23 licenses to French fishermen to alleviate tensions between the two neighbors who have been at loggerheads over the fishing row for the past six months.
France is seeking 81 more approvals to reach 104 licenses needed for its boats to operate in British and Channel Island waters under the Brexit agreement signed last year.
The European Union had specified a December 10 deadline for London to grant licenses to French fishing boats under Brexit, with Paris threatening European legal action in case of no breakthrough.
Underlining that France is entitled to around 80 more UK licenses, a group representing fishermen in the key port of Boulogne-sur-Mer and others along the northern coast threatened late on Saturday to launch protests.
"Protests should be expected ... protests that will target British imports," the local CRPMEM fishing industry group for the Hauts-de-France region said in a statement.
The group said its members were "exasperated" by the news of only 23 new licenses and felt "betrayed" by the European Commission, which could launch legal action against Britain over the issue.
The CRPMEM said the protests would be "in line with blockades of ports in Brittany, Normandy and the north of France which took place on November 26."
On that day, French fishing boats briefly blocked ferries and other boats in the ports of Calais, Saint-Malo and Ouistreham, while vehicles were also sent to disrupt traffic seeking to use the Channel Tunnel rail link.
Several rounds of talks between the two sides have since been held but a durable solution has yet to be worked out.

This Arab state plans to boost trade with Russia
The United Arab Emirates plans to increase its trade turnover with Russia to $20 billion in the next five years, the country's Foreign Trade Minister Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi has announced.
"We are working with the Russian side to increase trade turnover to $20 billion over the next five years and to continue investing in other areas [of economic cooperation]," Al Zeyoudi told RIA news agency on Saturday during a plenary session of the Expo-2020 international forum in the UAE, which had been postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
According to the official, "relations between Abu Dhabi and Moscow are strategic."
He noted that up to 90% of all Russian investments in the Arab world are made in the UAE.
The UAE also significantly invests in Russia, making up some 80% of all Arab investments in Russia's economy.
"If we are talking about the number of Russian companies in the UAE, it has reached almost 4,000," Al Zeyoudi stated.
According to the minister, the UAE is already investing in several Russian sectors, including the petrochemical industry, oil and gas, the automotive industry and ports, and it plans to broaden this list.
In 2020, the trade turnover between the two states reached $3.3 billion, and in the first 10 months of 2021 its volume exceeded $4 billion, reaching a new record, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said last week.
According to the Ministry of Economics, this year Russia mainly exported mineral products, precious stones and metals to the UAE, while Russian imports from the Arab country included machinery, equipment and vehicles.

Boris Johnson teeters on edge of favour with Tory MPs
Boris Johnson has long been considered a king of comebacks.
And some Tory MPs hope he'll continue that streak by managing to rescue himself from plummeting poll ratings in the wake of a string of Downing Street parties in defiance of Covid laws.
The prime minister had tangled himself in knots by repeatedly denying any rules were broken before more reports and evidence emerged to suggest the opposite.
First there was the video of No 10 aides laughing while they discussed a Christmas gathering on 18 December last year.
Then Dominic Cummings, once Johnson's closest adviser, promised pictures had been taken of parties, and so with bated breath critics of the government waited for them to surface.
When an image was published on Sunday showing Johnson on a screen hosting a Christmas quiz for staffers tuning in from No 10 and at home, it was not quite the smoking gun some thought would finally skewer him, however.
The Sunday Mirror image shows Johnson with two aides who were dressed up with tinsel and a Santa hat - not socially distanced from one another, and clearly engaged in a social occasion while mixing households.
But it could have been worse.
There have been other parties hosted in No 10 and Conservative party headquarters in which people drank copious amounts of alcohol, played party games, exchanged secret Santa gifts and socialised into the small hours, sources have told media outlets including the Guardian, Mirror, BBC and Times.
Ministers will quietly breath a sigh of relief no pictures of these scenes have been leaked - yet.
While Johnson's attendance at the quiz broke the rules, according to Keir Starmer, the Labour leader and a former director of public prosecutions, Tory MPs think people will look at the photo and judge that it really shows him hosting a virtual quiz - a familiar sight during the pandemic.
The staff, dialling in from other rooms in No 10 while drinking and not socially distancing, cannot be seen.
On Sunday Nadhim Zahawi insisted the picture was just an example of Johnson "thanking his staff" and used it to play down the party scandal as "hype."
He told LBC: "On that front page, I think your listeners will look at that and see a PM in his office, with the two close people that work with him, with no alcohol, taking 10 to 15 minutes to thank and motivate his staff, who have been coming in because they can't work from home."
Much damage has already been done, with mutinous MPs furious at the prime minister allowing a "one rule for them" narrative to take hold, from Cummings to Matt Hancock and more recently Owen Paterson.
Johnson is teetering on the edge of favour with his own MPs; if further photos surface, they may push him over the edge.

Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again
Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.
Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world.
Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.
That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself.
As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.
However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes.
NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators.
All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up.
This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match.
Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.

A post-mortem revealed he died from a stab wound to the chest.

We still don't know the reason he was killed.
A young, energetic 18-year-old, his dream was to be a digital marketing specialist.
The whole community are shocked.
May God be with the family he left behind, especially his parents."

Detective Inspector Hannah Whitehouse, from the homicide unit, said: "Yahya was just 18 and with his life ahead of him.
This has now been taken away in the most tragic of circumstances.
There is no clear motive for the attack and we're working round the clock to identify and trace who was responsible.
We've spoken to a number of witnesses but we still need to hear from anyone with information who can help us.

Makeshift Munster crush Wasps in Champions Cup cracker
Munster overran Wasps in a thrillingly chaotic Heineken Champions Cup clash contested by makeshift teams besieged by Covid and injury problems.
A rollercoaster first half ended with Munster leading 13-7 after Wasps skipper Brad Shields had been controversially sent off for a dangerous tackle on Dave Kilcoyne.
And with hooker Dan Frost sin-binned on the stroke of half-time, their 13 men were on the ropes and Munster reacted by engineering tries for debutant Patrick Campbell and Andrew Conway.
Alfie Barbeary's all-action display capped by a captivating try had given Wasps hope but he was unexpectedly replaced at half-time and it became one-way traffic from the moment Campbell showed his class to finish in the 43rd minute.
Missing 17 players to injury, Wasps also had to contend with the loss of four more to Covid in the morning, resulting in a hasty reconfiguration of the team.
Munster, meanwhile, were missing 34 squad personnel because of quarantine following their recent ill-fated United Rugby Championship trip to South Africa, creating five debutants in the starting XV and another seven on the bench.
Crucially, however, Ireland stars such as Tadhg Beirne, Peter O'Mahony, Conor Murray and Keith Earls were present to stiffen their ranks.
For all the absentees, it was an enjoyable spectacle where it appeared at times anything could happen, at least until Munster showed the extraordinary depth of their playing resources to pull clear.
Wasps' Covid-affected start to the day was compounded when play got underway, with Thomas Young denied a certain try by O'Mahony's excellent covering tackle.
And while Joey Carbery sent a penalty between the uprights to draw first blood for Munster, Jimmy Gopperth struck the crossbar to continue the two-time champions' unfortunate opening.
But their scrum was offering a foothold in the game and it took feverish defence to keep their maul at bay until they produced the first of two turnovers in quick succession.
Munster were fighting for every ball in defiance of their absentees and their victory prospects received a dramatic boost when Shields was shown his dubious red card, with referee Romain Poite saying his shoulder had caught Kilcoyne's neck.
Carbery directed a simple penalty at the post and while he was on target soon after, a dramatic twist followed as Wasps plundered a stunning try through Barbeary.
It concluded an exhilarating spell of end-to-end rugby in which the rivals took it in turns to attack from deep and, having been at the heart of the home advances, Barbeary delivered the telling blow.
A kind bounce off Murray's kick presented Earls with the simplest of tries as Munster hit back and then Frost departed for the sin-bin as the home side were reduced to 13.
It did not take long for the advantage in personnel to be felt as Beirne started a breakout try that ended with full-back Campbell producing a brilliant finish.
And Munster were out of sight in the 49th minute when a loose pass during a promising counter-attack fell for Conway to scoop up and complete a simple run-in.
Hooker Scott Buckley, man of the match on his Munster debut, was the next over from a lineout move and that was the game won, although Michael Le Bourgeois picked a quality line to improve Wasps' final score.

The vast majority of my family and friends who knew me before treat me the same and are SO.
damn.
supportive.
I do have a select few familial relationships, which were strained to begin with, where it seems that my weight loss has exacerbated the existing problems.
This could be the result of their complexes or mine, because I think they’re used to being able to shit on me and I, in turn, am now even less willing to take their shit.
One person in particular has, very weirdly, tried to take credit for my weight loss.
Basically, they’ve insinuated that they were the driving force that got me here, under the guise of being supportive, when in reality they didn’t even know I was making these changes until I had already gone through with the RNY and lost well over 100lbs.
In fact, they were the last to know, intentionally, because I just didn’t want them to try to take control and bully me into things like I used to let them.
Unsurprisingly, now they’ve taken to insulting my other features, like telling me my nose and forehead look too big since I lost weight and that I need a nose job and bangs to fix it - this is typical behavior from them.
At first, they just private messaged me these things but when I didn’t respond, they took to commenting about it publicly on social media, with no shame.

It was more isolating than I realized because it’s what I was used to.
I knew people could be judgmental of my size - with many doing so openly - but I never realized, until I lost weight, the micro-level of it and just how subtle it can come about.
Not only was I unaware of it, simply because it’s what I was used to, but I also don’t think those who perpetuate it are actively aware they’re doing it.
I really believe it is a subconscious bias, bred and exacerbated by the portrayal and treatment of overweight people in media, that many people just don’t realize they project.
Now, it feels like everyone everywhere looks at me, smiles at me, talks to me, etc.
Both men and women engage with me differently, making more efforts to talk to/get to know me - and that’s just platonically.
Romantically, my dating pool has expanded from what few were willing to be seen with me to what feels like… everyone lol.
It is DAUNTING.
I assumed that, at the very least, the fact that I was morbidly obese, have lost all this weight and now have excess skin would deter some people, but despite the fact that I put my weight loss and excess skin right at the forefront (because I don’t want it to be a secret), it has bothered/deterred approximately no one in my experience.
It seems to have done the opposite and made them more interested, actually.
Huge shock to me.

Free Training on CompTIA A+ | Will Cover Full Course
I'm currently delivering free training on the CompTIA A+ course.
The course consists of 18 modules and I will be doing a dedicated video on each module.
Some of these videos might be a bit long since it will be a whole module in each video so please feel free to make use of the time stamps in descriptions if you're looking for specific topics only or just want to refresh on certain topics only.
The time stamps are there to make life easier for you so it's your own fault if you end up skimming through the module back and forth like a crazy person looking for their lost teeth.
I will make 20 videos for this course, the first is just the 4 min intro explaining the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video and then obviously the 18 videos in between will be your modules.
The training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A+, and the other courses I deliver should also be enough to pass the exams associated if there is a exam associated to that specific course.
If you have a question about a specific topic in a module or the course in general that you would like more clarity on, please feel free to ask and I will try to assist you where I can if I'm online.
Here is the course intro

Joe Biden Laments Failure to Stop Global Warming After Deadly Tornados
President Joe Biden lamented the world's failure to stop global warming on Saturday after addressing the deadly tornadoes that swept through several states.
"We all know that everything is more intense when the climate is warming.
Everything," he said.
"And obviously it has some impact here."
At least 30 tornadoes were reported across six different states causing widespread devastation, and over 100 people are expected killed from the storm.
The president said he did not know the full extent of global warming's contribution to the deadly storms, which he described as one of the "largest tornado outbreaks in history."
He said he would get the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate.
"All that I know is that the intensity of the weather across the board has some impact as a consequence of the warming of the planet," Biden said.
The president praised the reporter who asked him about climate change.
"As usual, you ask always the best question," he said with a wry chuckle.
"How are we going to handle this?" he continued.
"Part of it is acknowledging that the likelihood of fewer weather catastrophes, absent of continued movement on dealing with global warming, it's just not going to happen."
Biden said he was shocked by the record wildfires in the country during 2021, expressing alarm that global warming was a major contribution.
"So we have to act," he said.
Biden said the first step was to save lives and care for the families who were affected by the storms.
"I promise you.
Whatever is needed.
Whatever is needed, the federal government is going to supply it," Biden said.
He said he would continue to monitor the storm recovery closely and do whatever was needed by the federal government.
"I want folks in all these states to know.
We're going to get through this.
We're going to get through this together and the federal government is not going to walk away," he said.
"This is one of those times when we aren't Democrats or Republicans."
The president said he would visit the storm affected areas when it was clear he would not get in the way of local rescue efforts.
"I do plan on going," he said.

Aston Villa latest Premier League club to suffer Covid outbreak
Aston Villa have become the latest Premier League outfit to suffer a Covid outbreak, with a number of positive cases discovered at the club.
Sunday's training session at Bodymoor Heath was cancelled as a result, a session that was designed for just a small number of players' recovery after the loss to Liverpool on Saturday.
It is not thought to be a serious outbreak at this stage, with The Athletic reporting that just one player has tested positive, with the rest being staff at the training ground.
Villa face an away game at Norwich City on Tuesday night in the Premier League and there is no suggestion that it will be cancelled, with training also expected to go ahead as normal on Monday.
The identity of the player that has tested positive has not been confirmed, nor whether it was any of the men who were involved against Liverpool.
Manchester United have also suffered a Covid outbreak on Sunday and there seems to be more concern about that situation, with the Red Devil's trip to Brentford on Tuesday now reportedly under threat.
Tottenham Hotspur have already been struggling with the virus, with their match against Brighton on Sunday postponed after eight players and five members of staff returned positive results.
Championship sides West Brom and Queens Park Rangers have also suffered outbreaks and QPR's clash with Sheffield United on Monday has been postponed.

Avalanche at Washington state ski resort kills 1, traps 5
An avalanche swept through part of a Washington state ski resort used to access backcountry skiing on Saturday, killing a 60-year-old man and temporarily trapping five others.
The avalanche was reported about 10:50 a.m. in the Silver Basin area of Crystal Mountain, which is located about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southeast of Seattle, said Pierce County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Darren Moss.
The identity of the man who died hasn't been released, but authorities say he wasn't breathing after being pulled out of the snow and didn't survive despite CPR efforts by another skier.
The other skiers in his group rescued themselves with the help of two witnesses who saw them get swept up by the snow.
All were wearing avalanche beacons.
While all of those caught in the avalanche were experienced backcountry skiers, a warning had been issued against skiing in the area, which was just inside the boundaries of Crystal Mountain Resort.
The private ski resort determines the conditions but there is nothing that stops skiers from going there because the property abuts public lands in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.
Frank DeBerry, the resort's president and CEO, said all six men held the ski resort's uphill travel passes, which means they were registered with ski patrol, participated in an orientation on how and where to access backcountry skiing through the resort's property and were required to check snow conditions prior to their excursion.
"Skiers can travel at will wherever they want in the national forest.
They had gone out into the forest but ended up back in bounds (of the resort) where this slide occurred," DeBerry said
In addition to shutting the area where the slide occurred, the resort earlier in the day closed the Mt. Rainier Gondola because of winds reaching 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour).
The avalanche came amid the season's first major snowfall.
The area is under a winter storm warning until Sunday morning, with the National Weather Service saying 12 to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow is possible for areas above 2,000 feet (610 meters).
"We've had a late start to the season and now we've gone from virtually no snow to a giant snow storm.
People got excited," DeBerry said.
"We all have to remember that it's a sport that carries risk."
Crystal Mountain is the largest ski resort in Washington state, encompassing 2,600 acres (1,052 hectares).

Organisations on high alert as techs race to fix software flaw
A critical vulnerability in a widely used software tool - one quickly exploited in the online game Minecraft - is rapidly emerging as a major threat to organizations around the world.
"The internet's on fire right now," said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike.
"People are scrambling to patch," he said, "and all kinds of people scrambling to exploit it."
He said Friday morning that in the 12 hours since the bug's existence was disclosed that it had been "fully weaponised," meaning malefactors had developed and distributed tools to exploit it.
The flaw may be the worst computer vulnerability discovered in years.
It was uncovered in a utility that's ubiquitous in cloud servers and enterprise software used across industry and government.
Unless it is fixed, it grants criminals, spies and programming novices alike easy access to internal networks where they can loot valuable data, plant malware, erase crucial information and much more.
Cyber attacks are now seen as the biggest threat to financial stability.
"I'd be hard-pressed to think of a company that's not at risk," said Joe Sullivan, chief security officer for Cloudflare, whose online infrastructure protects websites from malicious actors.
Untold millions of servers have it installed, and experts said the fallout would not be known for several days.
Amit Yoran, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Tenable, called it "the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade" - and possibly the biggest in the history of modern computing.
The vulnerability, dubbed "Log4Shell," was rated 10 on a scale of one to 10 the Apache Software Foundation, which oversees development of the software.
Anyone with the exploit can obtain full access to an unpatched computer that uses the software.
Experts said the extreme ease with which the vulnerability lets an attacker access a web server - no password required - is what makes it so dangerous.
New Zealand's computer emergency response team was among the first to report that the flaw was being "actively exploited in the wild" just hours after it was publicly reported Thursday and a patch released.
The vulnerability, located in open-source Apache software used to run websites and other web services, was reported to the foundation on November 24 by the Chinese tech giant Alibaba, it said.
It took two weeks to develop and release a fix.

Libya: plan for presidential election on 24 December close to collapse
The chances of Libya staging its first presidential elections on the long planned date of 24 December appeared close to collapse on Sunday after the body overseeing the vote said it was unable to announce the the approved candidates because of continued legal doubts.
With the elections less than a fortnight away and virtually no time for campaigning, a postponement would represent a bitter blow to the international community's hopes of reuniting the deeply divided country.
Foreign powers will also fear the overall momentum towards democracy could dissipate.
In the short term they will have to agree whether or not the interim government continues in order to fill the political vacuum and prevent a return to civil war.
A series of court rulings have overturned the Libyan electoral commission's decisions to block high-profile figures including Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of the former dictator, from standing for the presidency.
The interim prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah and warlord Khalifa Haftar, the head of the self-styled Libyan National Army, have meanwhile been approved by the commission but subsequently appealed by other parties.
It said in a statement on Saturday it said could not announce the names of the approved candidates out of the nearly who 100 have applied because it was "keen to exhaust all means of litigation to ensure its decisions comply with issued judgements."
Rival factions have accused each other of intimidating or bribing judicial officials to secure their reinstatement of their candidates, and the commission is looking to see if the decisions were valid.
In the case of Dbeibah, he had pledged as a condition of becoming interim PM that he would not stand for election but has since argued in court that this was a moral pledge with no legal force.
Saif Gaddafi was convicted in absentia in 2015 on war crimes charges for his part in fighting the revolution that toppled his father, Muammar Gaddafi.
He denies wrongdoing.
The presence of tens of thousands of foreign fighters, mercenaries and indigenous militia make the country a tinderbox, and there are fears an election conducted with disputed candidates would only lead to a result that was not recognized.
In a sign of the tensions over foreign forces, France is pressing the EU to agree on Monday to impose sanctions on the Russian private military contractor Wagner Group, which it says operates in Libya and the Sahel.
Moscow denies Wagner is linked to the Russian state and has said it would retaliate against EU sanctions placed on its citizens.
The international community's ability to demand the Libyan political class stick to the 24 December election date, which was first agreed in February, has been hampered by the appointment of a UN special envoy, Ján Kubiš, who resigned three weeks before the elections after less than a year in the post.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has since appointed Stephanie Williams, a forceful former UN deputy special envoy, to act as his special adviser.
Russia vetoed her appointment as a full envoy, but she has deep knowledge of Libya and last year displayed a willingness to confront those in the political class opposed to elections.
The UN mission issued a statement urging all sides not to reverse the gains made, pointing to the registration of nearly 3 million voters, the successful distribution of voter cards and the applications of large numbers of candidates for the presidency and parliament as signs of deep popular support for elections.
The US ambassador to Libya, Richard Norland, said "refusing to go to the elections and mobilizing to obstruct will only place the fate and future of the country at the mercy of those inside Libya and their external backers who prefer bullet power over ballot power."

Wendy Rogers Calls New Zealand PM 'Lenin With Hair,' Claims 'Satanic Communists' in U.S.
Republican Arizona Senator Wendy Rogers on Sunday called New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern "Lenin with Hair" and warned against communism in the United States.
Rogers appeared to be criticizing Ardern's COVID response as she referred to Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin in a Tweet she posted along with a short clip of the prime minister.
Rogers didn't further explain her criticism of Ardern in her Tweet.
In the clip, Ardern was speaking about COVID misinformation and New Zealand's efforts to keep people informed about the pandemic.
"More bold Christians are needed in office to counter the satanic Communists in both parties," the Arizona Senator wrote in another tweet on Sunday.
Her Tweet was met with ridicule from different social media users, with one person tweeting back: "Please offer your definitions of Communism and Christianity, because I don't think you understand either."
"I see that Wendy is going all out today, trying to compete with the craziest of the crazy," another person tweeted.
Rogers has been vocal about her stance against communism before on social media.
In September, she called Labor Day a "Communist Holiday" without further explanation.
Her tweet was mocked among social media users, including The Arizona House Democrats, who replied: "Says the heart and soul of Arizona's Republican Party (prove us wrong)."
"You do realize that if you keep falsely calling all good things communist you're only going to make communism more attractive, no?" asked another social media user.
Republican Senator Wendy Rogers warned against communists in America and called for having more "bold Christians" in office.
Writer Shiv Ramdas also denounced the tweet by paraphrasing her own words: "'working is Communism.'"
Separately, Rogers has frequently suggested that Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election and called for a new election.
"I call for the Biden electors to be recalled to Arizona & a new election must be conducted.
Arizona's electors must not be awarded fraudulently..." the senator tweeted in July.
In July, Rogers campaigned for the election to be decertified and previously launched a petition that she claimed gained 663,000 signatures.
"Things are really taking off!
Let's get to 1 million ASAP.
Audit results are coming soon, more states are coming online," she tweeted in September.
The Trump supporter has also pushed for debunked claims of voter fraud in Arizona.
Newsweek contacted Senator Rogers' office for comment.

'Interview with the Vampire' author Anne Rice dies at age 80
She passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke, Christopher Rice said.
Rice's biggest success was her first novel, "Interview with the Vampire," which was published in 1976 and introduced the character of the vampire Lestat, who would be the central character in the 13-book Chronicles series, the most recent of which was published in 2018.
"I had an idea of Lestat as the man of action, the man who could do things that I couldn't do," Rice said in a talk at Southern Illinois University in 2010.
"Interview with the Vampire" was made into a successful feature film in 1994, helping to reignite interest in the vampire genre which continued with the TV series "The Vampire Diaries" and the "Twilight" film series.
Although she lived most of her life in California, Rice was a native of New Orleans and set many of her stories there, according to her website biography.
Rice's son, Christopher Rice, said he was at his mother's bedside when she died.
Anne Rice will be buried in a private ceremony in New Orleans, with a public memorial planned next year, he said.

Assam Anti-CAA Outfits Pay Tributes To People Who Died During Protests
Five agitators were killed during the anti-CAA stirs in Assam two years ago.
Several organisations in Assam on Sunday paid tributes to the five agitators who were killed in the anti-CAA stir two years ago, and resolved to resume the movement against the Act.
Memorial meetings were organised at the residence of Sam Stafford, one of the agitators who died, and a playground in Guwahati, with attendees resolving to once again to intensify the stir against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.
The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), which was among the first groups to organise protests against CAA after it was passed in Parliament, paid tributes to the agitators at Sam Stafford's Hatigaon residence.
Sibsagar MLA Akhil Gogoi, who was a Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti leader during the stir and was jailed for his role in it, while paying floral tributes at the photographs of those who died, said that political parties and "nationalist organisations" must take the lead in resuming the movement.
Commenting on the artiste fraternity that had taken the centerstage in the 2019 stir, he said, "We can't expect them to organise agitations.
Their help is crucial but they shouldn't be blamed for not reviving the movement."
All Assam Students' Union (AASU), another key player in the stir, organised a memorial at the Hatigaon Higher Secondary School playground.
Speaking on the occasion, AASU chief advisor Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya said, "It is wrong to say that the anti-CAA movement has died out.
It had lost its intensity due to the commencement of examinations (in January 2020) and then the pandemic and lockdowns.
We will resume the agitation with full intensity once again.
We won't let the sacrifices go in vain," he said.
Mr Bhattacharya said the anti-CAA agitation will once again be a pan-Northeast one like in 2019.
Singer-music composer Zubeen Garg, who had taken a leading role in the 2019 protests, also paid his tributes at the programme organised by the AASU.
"We won't accept the CAA and that is for sure.
The government is trying to confuse us, but we won't allow them to make us accept it," he said.
Several organisations, including AASU, North East Students' Organisation (NESO) and Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), had observed "black day" on December 11 to mark two years of the passage of CAA in Parliament.

We conducted a retrospective study that reviewed all clinical records of patients with SLE and severe pneumonia admitted to the ICU between 2008 and 2020.
A total of 86 SLE patients with severe pneumonia during their first ICU admission were enrolled in this study.
Most patients were female (n = 71, 82.5%), and the median age was 42.3 ± 14.7 years.
The most common organisms were gram-positive bacteria (20.9%), followed by gram-negative bacteria (18.6%) and fungi (10.4%).
A total of 31 patients died within 30 days of ICU admission, and the 30-day mortality was 36%.
In binary logistic regression analysis, Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and mechanical ventilation were dependently associated with 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] 2.97, P = 0.016; OR = 4.02, P = 0.023; OR = 1.52, P = 0.036; respectively).
Among the other 55 patients, 5 patients died after discharge from the ICU during the long-term follow-up.
Mortality was high in SLE patients with severe pneumonia admitted to the ICU, and most of the patients died within 30 days of ICU admission.
Mastocytosis is a clonal hematopoietic disorder characterized by proliferation of abnormal mast cells in various organs including the skin, digestive system, lymph nodes, and bone marrow.
We report on a 75-year-old woman presenting with abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, and weight loss.
Abdominal CT showed hepatosplenomegaly with heterogeneous splenic parenchyma, lymphadenopathy, and osteopenia with areas of osteosclerosis but no primary tumour.
Subsequently, bone marrow and peripheral blood examinations confirmed the diagnosis of aggressive systemic mastocytosis.
13 patients (9 male, 4 female, 69.6 ± 16.6 y/o) with 14 RCCs (largest diameter: 40.4 ± 6.7 mm, cT1a: 4, cT1b: 10) were treated by RFA a median of one day after TAE in a single center.
Indications for minimally invasive interventional therapy were bilateral RCCs (n = 4), RCCs in a single kidney after nephrectomy (n = 3), increased surgical risk due to comorbidities (n = 4), and rejection of surgical therapy (n = 2).
Technical success, effectiveness, safety, ablative margin, cancer-specific survival, overall survival, and tumor characteristics were analyzed.
All RCCs were successfully ablated after embolization with a minimum ablative margin of 1.2 mm.
The median follow-up was 27 (1-83) months.
There was no residual or recurrent tumor in the ablation zone.
No patient developed metastasis.
Two minor and two major complications occurred.
Four patients with severe comorbidities died during follow-up due to causes unrelated to therapy.
The 1-year and 5-year overall survival was 74.1 % each.
Cancer-specific survival was 100 % after 1 and 5 years.
There was no significant decline in mean eGFR directly after therapy (p = 0.226).
However, the mean eGFR declined from 62.2 ± 22.0 to 50.0 ± 27.8 ml/min during follow-up (p < 0.05).
The combination of TAE and RFA provides an effective minimally invasive therapy to stage 1 RCCs in patients ineligible for surgery.
The outcomes compare favorably with data from surgery.
Transanal protrusion of intussusception (TAPI; also known as prolapsed intussusception) is a rare complication.
Here, we present a successful colonoscopic reduction of ileocolic intussusception presented with transanal prolapse.
An 8‑month male child, weighing 8 kg, was referred to our hospital presenting with a mass in his anal canal, diarrhea and rectal bleeding for two days.
The sonographic evaluation revealed an ileocolic intussusception in the rectosigmoid area.
The patient was treated using colonoscopic reduction.
To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting colonoscopic reduction for transanal prolapsed intussusceptions.
Our study suggests gastroenterologists to consider colonoscopy as a therapeutic method for prolapsed intussusceptions and encourages them to attempt reducing the invagination using this method before laparotomy, especially in cases presenting within 48 h of onset of symptoms and no peritonitis symptoms.

Hemostasis is a complex and tightly regulated system that attempts to maintain a homeostatic balance to permit normal blood flow, without bleeding or thrombosis.
Hemostasis reflects the subtle balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant factors in the pathways of primary hemostasis, secondary hemostasis, and fibrinolysis.
The major components in this interplay include the vascular endothelium, platelets, coagulation factors, and fibrinolytic factors.
After vessel wall injury, the subendothelium is exposed to the blood stream, followed by rapid activation of platelets via collagen binding and von Willebrand factor-mediated platelet adhesion to the damaged vessel wall through platelet glycoprotein receptor Ib/IX/V. Activated platelets change their shape, release bioactive molecules from their granules, and expose negatively charged phospholipids on their surface.
For a proper function of this process, an adequate number of functional platelets are required.
Subsequently, a rapid generation of sufficient amounts of thrombin begins; followed by activation of the coagulation system and its coagulation factors (secondary hemostasis), generating fibrin that consolidates the platelet plug.
To maintain equilibrium between coagulation and anticoagulation, the naturally occurring anticoagulants such as protein C, protein S, and antithrombin keep this process in balance.
Deficiencies (inherited or acquired) at any level of this fine-tuned system result in pathologic bleedings or increased hypercoagulability states leading to thrombosis.
This review will focus on genetic diagnosis of inherited bleeding, thrombotic, and platelet disorders, discussing strengths and limitations of existing diagnostic settings and genetic tools and highlight some important considerations necessary for clinical application.
Platelets play critical roles in hemostasis and thrombosis.
While low platelet counts increase the risk of bleeding, antithrombotic drugs, including anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, are used to treat thromboembolic events.
Thus, the management of thrombosis in patients with low platelet counts is challenging with hardly any evidence available to guide treatment.
Recognition of the underlying cause of thrombocytopenia is essential for assessing the bleeding risk and tailoring therapeutic options.
A typical clinical scenario is the occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients experiencing transient thrombocytopenia during myelosuppressive chemotherapy.
In such patients, the severity of thrombocytopenia, thrombus burden, clinical symptoms, and the timing of VTE relative to thrombocytopenia must be considered. In clinical practice, distinct hematological disorders characterized by low platelet counts and a thrombogenic state require specific diagnostics and treatment. These include the antiphospholipid syndrome, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and (spontaneous) HIT syndromes, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
The patellofemoral joint morphology geometries of 33 patients before and after implantation of a bicondylar total knee replacement was intraoperatively analyzed using a digital scanning method.
Femoral surface geometries were extracted from intraoperatively recorded tactile scanning data using an in-house algorithm. The geometries were then characterized by sulcus height, medial femoral condyle height and lateral femoral condyle height.
Our preliminary results show that these key geometric parameters are only partially restored after TKA leading to a distinctly different shaped profile of the anterior distal femur.
Maximum and minimum mean differences in sulcus height, medial femoral condyle height, and lateral femoral condyle height before and after surgery were 2.00 mm/-3.06 mm, 2.51 mm/-6.25 mm and 2.74 mm/-3.58 mm, respectively.
A new method for intraoperative analysis of the patellofemoral joint morphology before and after TKA without radiation exposure was developed and utilized.
Even with the use of modern total knee designs, the patellofemoral articulation is considerably changed postoperatively as quantified by the key parameters of sulcus height, medial femoral condyle height, and lateral femoral condyle height.
This may result in altered knee biomechanics and might explain persistent patellofemoral disorders, which are often reported by patients after TKA.
This narrative review sums up data from the SARS-CoV-2-pandemia on preexisting disease/underlying conditions/comorbidities and risk factors in children for severe COVID-19 and MIS-C/PIMS-TS as well as hospitalization and mortality.
Young infants and adolescents are at highest risk of hospital and PICU admission.
Two or more comorbidities rather than single entities pose a risk for more severe courses of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.
Asthma and malignancy do not increase complication rates.
MIS-C/PIMS-TS is not associated with any specific underlying disease.
Extensive exophytic pigmented viral plaques developed on a Chihuahua dog causing pruritus and discomfort.

This case illustrates the difficulty in treating viral plaques and the progressive nature of this disease.
Patients from the general practice who had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection between January 2020 and March 2021 participated in an online survey to report their symptoms.
This observational study describes the broad range of mild to moderate symptoms experienced by 160 symptom-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) nonhospitalized patients, including 89 laboratory-confirmed cases.
Compared to confirmed cases, a higher number of presumed and suspected patients had sore throat, shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, fatigue, or severe neck tension.
Unexpected COVID-19-associated clinical features, such as alteration of blood consistency, hormonal imbalance, increased muscle tone and/or aches of skeletal muscles, joint pain, or dermatological disorders were observed by the participants.
In the early period of the pandemic, COVID-19 diagnosis of patients was based on medical symptoms rather than polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serological testing.
These real-world data are essential to understand the pathophysiology of this virus infection and to develop innovative therapeutic approaches.
Women with a medical indication for surgery due to urinary incontinence problems but who had not yet had surgery (N = 110) and same-age women who had had a surgical procedure for urinary incontinence (N = 101) completed a set of questionnaires.
The results showed that women with urinary incontinence had significantly higher life satisfaction than women who underwent the operation.
Contrary to expectations, women with urinary incontinence problems reported equal levels of life satisfaction to a comparable sample of postmenopausal normative women.
Higher levels of life satisfaction were related to higher education level, employment, higher perceived socioeconomic level, and urban place of living.
It is important for physicians to address the problem of urinary incontinence with their patients and to examine the present anxiety symptoms, given that they may affect their subjective wellbeing.
Since nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the leading cause of liver disease in the Western world, clinicians need reliable noninvasive tools for the identification of NAFLD-associated fibrosis.
Limited evidence on the performance of the novel shear wave elastography technique Elast-PQ (EPQ) in NAFLD is available.
In this prospective, European multinational study we assessed the diagnostic accuracy of EPQ using vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) as a reference standard.
EPQ was able to identify NAFLD-fibrosis risk with the following EPQ cutoffs: ≥6.5 kPa for significant fibrosis (≥F2) (≥1.47 m/s; sensitivity: 78%; specificity: 95%; AUROC: 0.94), ≥6.9 kPa for advanced fibrosis (≥F3) (≥1.52 m/s; sens.: 88%, spec.: 89%; AUROC: 0.949), and ≥10.4 kPa for cirrhosis (F4) (≥1.86 m/s; sens.: 87%; spec.: 94%; AUROC: 0.949).
The point shear wave elastography technique EPQ shows excellent correlation to and concordance with VCTE.
EPQ can reliably exclude NAFLD fibrosis <6.0 kPa (<1.41 m/s) and indicate a high risk of advanced fibrosis ≥10.4 kPa (≥1.86 m/s).
A displaced anterior glenoid rim fracture, the so-called bony Bankart lesion, occurs after a traumatic shoulder dislocation resulting from a high energy trauma and is associated with recurrent shoulder instability.
Different surgical techniques have been described in the literature to address this pathology, including open reduction and fixation, as well as arthroscopic transosseous, and single-row or double-row approaches with the use of suture anchors.
However, there is currently no gold standard of treatment and the stability of fixation and the healing of the bony fragment are still a concern.
The purpose of this report was to introduce an arthroscopic independent double-row (IDR) bony Bankart repair technique for fixation of large glenoid fractures.
Irreparable anterior rotator cuff injuries require treatment that seeks to restore the dynamic anterior forces of the glenohumeral joint.
Among surgical treatment options, transfer of the pectoralis major and minor muscle, have shown good functional outcomes.
This technique attempts to reproduce the vector of the subscapular muscle in cases with irreparable tear.
Pectoralis major transfer (PMa): Irreparable subscapularis tendon (SSC) tear in active patients without osteoarthritis.
Pectoralis minor transfer (PMi): Irreparable superior SSC tear with concomitant irreparable supraspinatus tendon (SSP) tear in active patients with no osteoarthritis.
Primary osteoarthritis Samilson grade C, cuff tear arthropathy Hamada III-V, infection, axillary nerve palsy, older patients with low physical demand, combination with irreparable SSP/infraspinatus tendon (ISP) tear for PMa or combination with irreparable ISP tear for PMi.

PMa: Detachment of the tendon to be transferred from the humeral insertion, blunt anatomic dissection medially.
Exposure of the conjoined tendon and coracoid process.
PMi: Detachment of the tendon with an osteotomy at the coracoid process.
The PMa tendon is fixed in a 2-row configuration, the PMi in a single row with suture anchors to the lesser tuberosity.
Shoulder abduction sling (30°) for 6 weeks.
Assisted range-of-motion (ROM) exercises with abduction/adduction 60-0-0°, internal/external rotation free-0-0° for 6 weeks.
Free active ROM exercises after 6 weeks, muscle strengthening after 12 weeks.
The pectoralis major and minor transfer shows an improvement in strength and range of motion in young active patients and an improved Constant score (CS) in long-term follow-up examinations.
However, the comparative effects of different appliances have not been adequately assessed.
Thus, the aim was to assess the occlusal outcome of orthodontic treatment with preadjusted straight-wire (SWIRE) and standard edgewise (SEDGE) appliances.
In all, 56 patients (mean age: 13.5 years; 45% male) receiving extraction-based treatment with either SWIRE or SEDGE appliances were included.
Between-group differences in the occlusal outcome assessed with the American Board of Orthodontists Objective Grading System (ABO-OGS) and treatment duration were analyzed statistically at the 5% level.
The average ABO-OGS score was 31.3 ± 7.2 points and 34.0 ± 10.4 points in the SWIRE and SEDGE groups with no statistically significant difference between groups (P = 0.26).
Treatment duration was significantly shorter in the SWIRE group compared to the SEDGE group, with an average difference of -6.8 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = -9.6 to -4.0 months; P < 0.001).
Likewise, fewer visits were needed with SWIRE compared to SEDGE appliances with an average difference of -7.2 visits (95% CI = -10.3 to -4.2 visits; P < 0.001).
Adjusting for the influence of any potential confounders did not considerably impact the results.
Similar treatment outcomes were observed after premolar extraction treatment with SWIRE and SEDGE appliances.
On the other hand, SEDGE appliances were associated with prolonged treatment duration and more visits needed to complete treatment compared to SWIRE appliances.
Multiparametric MRI of the prostate has become a fundamental tool in the diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer and is recommended before (or after negative) biopsy to guide biopsy and increase accuracy, as a staging examination (high-risk setting), and prior to inclusion into active surveillance.
Despite this main field of application, prostate MRI can be utilized to obtain information in a variety of benign disorders of the prostate.
Systematic bibliographical research with extraction of studies, national (German) as well as international guidelines (EAU, AUA), and consensus reports on MRI of benign disorders of the prostate was performed.
Indications and imaging findings of prostate MRI were identified for a) imaging the enlarged prostate, b) prostate MRI in prostatic artery embolization, c) imaging in prostatitis and d) imaging in congenital anomalies.
Different phenotypes of the enlarged prostate that partly correlate with severity of symptoms are discussed.
This paper focuses on disability, an under-researched area of inequality, and subjective well-being.
According to social production function theory, people with a disability do not have the same opportunities as people without disabilities to obtain resources, instrumental goals, and ultimately subjective well-being.
Social participation and employment seem to be crucial mechanisms behind such disparities.
The social system of a country (macro level) also shapes the gap in subjective well-being between both groups.
The main objective of this paper is to analyse the gap in subjective well-being between people with and without disabilities.
How is this gap linked to social participation and labour market integration, and how does the welfare-state regime shape the gap in subjective well-being between people with and without disabilities? The core of this research are multilevel analyses of cumulative European Social Survey data from 31 European countries.
The results reveal that people with disabilities show significantly lower subjective well-being than people without disabilities.
Welfare-state regimes have an effect on this gap, with social-democratic (and family-oriented) Nordic countries performing best in providing equal living conditions for people with and without disabilities.
Retrospective analysis of patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and chest CT performed between March 07 and November 13, 2020.
Volume and percentage (PO) of lung opacifications and mean HU of the whole lung were quantified using prototype software.
13 laboratory values were collected.
Negative outcome was defined as death, ICU admittance, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
Positive outcome was defined as care in the regular ward or discharge.
Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of CT parameters and laboratory values.
Independent predictors were combined to establish a scoring system for prediction of prognosis.
This score was validated on a separate validation cohort.
89 patients were included for model development between March 07 and April 27, 2020 (mean age: 60.3 years). 38 patients experienced a negative outcome.
In univariate regression analysis, all quantitative CT parameters as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), relative lymphocyte count (RLC), troponin, and LDH were associated with a negative outcome.
In a multivariate regression analysis, PO, CRP, and RLC were independent predictors of a negative outcome.
Combination of these three values showed a strong predictive value with a C-index of 0.87.
A scoring system was established which categorized patients into 4 groups with a risk of 7 %, 30 %, 67 %, or 100 % for a negative outcome.
The validation cohort consisted of 28 patients between May 5 and November 13, 2020.
A negative outcome occurred in 6 % of patients with a score of 0, 50 % with a score of 1, and 100 % with a score of 2 or 3.
The combination of PO, CRP, and RLC showed a high predictive value for a negative outcome.
A phantom study using 7 human renal calculi was performed to test both protocols.
120 consecutive unenhanced CT examinations performed due to suspicion of renal calculi were included in this retrospective, monocentric study.
60 examinations were included with the standard-dose protocol (SP) (100 kV/130 mAs), whereas another 60 studies were included using a low-dose protocol (LD) applying spectral shaping with tin filtration of high tube voltages (Sn150 kV/80 mAs).
Image quality was assessed by two radiologists in consensus blinded to technical parameters using an equidistant Likert scale ranging from 1-5 with 5 being the highest score.
Quantitative image quality was assessed using regions of interest in abdominal organs, muscles, and adipose tissue to analyze image noise and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).
Commercially available dosimetry software was used to determine and compare effective dose (ED) and size-specific dose estimates (SSDEmean).
All seven renal calculi of the phantom could be detected with both protocols.
There was no difference regarding calcluli size between the two protocols except for the smallest one.
The smallest concretion measured 1.5 mm in LD and 1.0 mm in SP (ground truth 1.5 mm).
CTDIvol was 3.36 mGy in LD (DLP: 119.3 mGycm) and 8.27 mGy in SP (DLP: 293.6 mGycm).
The mean patient age in SP was 47 ± 17 years and in LD 49 ± 13 years.
Ureterolithiasis was found in 33 cases in SP and 32 cases in LD.
The median concretion size was 3 mm in SP and 4 mm in LD.
The median ED in LD was 1.3 mSv (interquartile range (IQR) 0.3 mSv) compared to 2.3 mSv (IQR 0.9 mSv) in SP (p < 0.001).
The SSDEmean of LD was also significantly lower compared to SP with 2.4 mGy (IQR 0.4 mGy) vs. 4.8 mGy (IQR 2.3 mGy) (p < 0.001).
The SNR was significantly lower in LD compared to SP (p < 0.001).
However, there was no significant difference between SP and LD regarding the qualitative assessment of image quality with a median of 4 (IQR 1) for both groups (p = 0.648).
Tin-filtered unenhanced abdominal CT for the detection of renal calculi using high tube voltages leads to a significant reduction of radiation exposure and yields high diagnostic image quality without a significant difference compared to the institution's standard of care low-dose protocol without tin filtration.
A total of 22 consecutive patients underwent coronary angiography and/or cardiac computed tomography (CT) including cardiac MRI.
The image quality was evaluated on a 3-point Likert scale.
Inter-reader variability for image quality was analyzed with Cohen's kappa for the main coronary segments (left circumflex [LCX], left anterior descending [LAD], right coronary artery [RCA]) and the left main trunk (LMT).
Inter-reader agreement for image quality of the coronary tree ranged from substantial to perfect, with a Cohen's kappa of 0.722 (RCA<sub>mid</sub>) to 1 (LCX<sub>prox</sub>).
The LMT had the best image quality.
Image quality of the proximal vessel segments differed significantly from the mid- and distal segments (RCA<sub>prox</sub> vs. RCA<sub>dist</sub>, p < 0.05).
The LCX segments showed no significant difference in image quality along the vessel length (LCX<sub>prox</sub> vs. LCX<sub>dist</sub>, p = n.s.).
The mean acquisition time for the study sequence was 553 s (±46 s).
Coronary imaging with a sparse 3D whole-heart sequence is feasible in a reasonable amount of time producing good-quality imaging.
Image quality was poorer in distal coronary segments and along the entire course of the LCX.
The treatment of complex injuries of the extremities after comminuted fractures or non-unions is a challenging area in the field of trauma surgery.
Internal, motorized implants nowadays enable a patient-oriented and progressive treatment of these cases.
The present article aims to present modern treatment strategies of complex injuries of the extremities, support the use of novel, motorized intramedullary nails and provide experiences for the handling with lengthening nails or transport nails.
For this purpose, the preoperative planning including selection of patients, presentation of internal lengthening and transport systems and the most important factors during preparation of the surgery are described.
Moreover, critical steps during the implantation of motorized nails and also during potential follow-up interventions are highlighted and the postoperative protocol including precise recommendations for the transport und consolidation phase are provided.
Finally, the experiences are illustrated by presentation of the four different cases.
The use of internal, motorized implants represents the latest step in the treatment of complex injuries of the extremities.
These implants improve the quality of life and the authors recommend its use.
However, these implants require a high expertise and adaption of established treatment protocols in these challenging trauma cases.
Follow-up analyses with a considerably large number of cases are necessary and the research on implants to solve persisting problems in the area of complex injuries of the extremities has to be pursued intensively.
Increasing numbers of patients surviving malignant bone tumors around the knee joint have led to an increasing importance to investigate long-term results.
This study assessed the long-term results of rotationplasty after resection of malignant bone tumors regarding functional outcome and quality of life to allow better comparison with other treatment options in bone cancer treatment.
60 participants who underwent rotationplasty due to bone cancer took part in this multicentric questionnaire-based study.
The long-term functional outcome was measured by the Musculoskeletal tumor society score (MSTS) and the Tegner activity level scale.
The health-related quality of life (HRQL) was assessed by using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).
Patients treated with rotationplasty (median follow-up of 22 years, range 10-47 years) regained a high level of activity (median MSTS score of 24).
Even a return to high level sports was possible (mean Tegner activity level scale of 4).
Duration of follow-up did not influence the functional outcome.
HRQL scores were comparable to the general German population.
Concerns of psychological problems due to the unusual appearance of the rotated foot have not been confirmed.
Rotationplasty can be a good alternative to endoprosthetic replacement or amputation, either as primary surgery or as a salvage procedure.
Especially for growing children and very active patients rotationplasty should be considered.
The reliability of the data, frequency of the causes of death and correlations with the mechanism of injury as well as the confirmability of the data in the TraumaRegister DGU are to be investigated.
The University Hospital Jena data were analysed for 203 deceased trauma patients from accidental death between 2007 and 2017.
A clear determination of the cause of death is possible in about 85% of cases on the basis of hospital data.
The most frequent cause of death of severely injured patients after admission to the hospital is traumatic brain injury (59.6%), followed by organ failure (17%), haemorrhage (14%) and other causes of death (9.4%).
Verification using data from the TraumaRegister DGU is possible.
There is a clear correlation between mechanism of injury and cause of death.
The cause of death is very often a subjective assessment of the recording doctor.
In particular, there are difficulties with patients who die in the resuscitation room before further diagnosis.
The most frequent cause of death today is traumatic brain injury.
For future evaluations, the new information in the TraumaRegister DGU is helpful because the cause of death can only be partially derived from other registry data.
The correlation between the type of accident and the cause of death could be used for preventive measures.
As vaccination campaigns are in progress in most countries, hopes to win back more normality are rising.
However, the exact path from a pandemic to an endemic virus remains uncertain.
While in the pre-vaccination phase many critical indoor situations were avoided by strict control measures, for the transition phase a certain mitigation of the effect of indoor situations seems advisable.
To better understand the mechanisms of indoor airborne transmissions, we present a new time-discrete model to calculate the level of exposure towards infectious SARS-CoV-2 aerosol and carry out a sensitivity analysis for the level of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol exposure in indoor settings.
Time limitations and the use of any kind of masks were found to be strong mitigation measures, while how far the effort for a strict use of professional face pieces instead of simple masks can be justified by the additional reduction of the exposure dose remains unclear.
Very good ventilation of indoor spaces is mandatory.
The definition of sufficient ventilation in regard to airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission follows other rules than the standards in ventilation design.
This means that especially smaller rooms most likely require a significantly greater fresh air supply than usual.
The benefits of a model in which the students come to school every day, but for a limited time, should be investigated.
In terms of window ventilation, it has been found that many short opening periods are not only thermally beneficial, they also reduce the exposure dose.
The fresh air supply is driven by the temperature gradient and wind speed.
However, the sensitivity towards these parameters is not very high and in times of low wind and temperature gradients, there are no arguments against keep windows open in order to make up for the reduced air flow rate.
Long total opening periods and large window surfaces will strongly reduce the exposure.
Additionally, the results underline the expectable fact that exposure doses will increase when hygiene and control measures are reduced.
It seems advisable to investigate what this means for the infection rate and the fatality of infections in populations with partial immunity.
Very basic considerations suggest that the value of aerosol reduction measures may be reduced with very infectious variants such as delta.
Alcoholic hepatitis is the acute deterioration of alcoholic liver disease with rapid onset or worsening of jaundice, which in severe cases, may transition to acute-on-chronic liver failure with extremely high short-term mortality, increasing with the number and severity of hepatic and extra-hepatic organ dysfunction.
Diagnosis and treatment are insufficient and challenging, especially due to the complex, multi-factorial and as yet not fully understood pathogenesis.
While current management is limited to steroids and best supportive care, debate is ongoing concerning liver transplantation for selected patients, and several novel approaches are under way with mixed results.
These drawbacks in disease management together with increasing prevalence in Germany, and generally in Western countries, constitute an unmet need for the healthcare systems.
This review tries to summarize the current status of these aspects and provides an overview for pathogenesis, management and potential future treatments.
Thrombus formation has been identified as an integral part in innate immunity, termed immunothrombosis.
Activation of host defense systems is known to result in a procoagulant environment.
In this system, cellular players as well as soluble mediators interact with each other and their dysregulation can lead to the pathological process of thromboinflammation.
These mechanisms have been under intensified investigation during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In this review, we focus on the underlying mechanisms leading to thromboinflammation as one trigger of venous thromboembolism.
In a cross-sectional study, the serum levels of S100A12 protein of 68 children (19 with cSLE, 18 with sJIA, 7 with SURFS, and 24 controls) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared between groups and with clinical and laboratory findings.
The median serum S100A12 levels were 469 ng/mL in the cSLE group, 6103 ng/mL in the sJIA group, 480 ng/mL in the SURFS group, and 44 ng/mL in the control group.
Children with cSLE, sJIA, and SURFS had significantly higher serum S100A12 levels compared to the control group (p < 0.0001).
sJIA patients had the highest levels of S100A12 in comparison to other patients (p < 0.0001), while there was no significant difference between children with cSLE and SURFS.
Elevated serum SA100A12 levels in children with cSLE, sJIA, and SURFS may indicate intense neutrophil activation, which may play an important role in innate immunity in chronic inflammation in these diseases.
Serum S100A12 levels could be used as a diagnostic marker of inflammation and be suitable for distinguishing sJIA and other disorders.
Adequate assessment instruments are needed to identify older persons with LSM restrictions, and to initiate, adapt or evaluate intervention strategies.
A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Web of Science.
Studies that examined at least one psychometric property of LSM questionnaires published up to August 2021 were included and evaluated based on the consensus-based standards for the selection of health measurement instruments (COSMIN) guidelines.
This study included 37 validation studies describing 13 different LSM questionnaires.
Methodological quality and comprehensiveness of validations were heterogeneous.
Based on comprehensive and high-quality results, four LSM questionnaires stood out: the University of Alabama at Birmingham life-space assessment (UAB-LSA), life-space assessment in persons with cognitive impairment (LSA-CI), interview-based and proxy-based versions of the life-space assessment in institutionalized settings (LSA-IS), all of them available in the German language.
This systematic review provides a concise overview of available LSM questionnaires and their psychometric properties to facilitate the selection for use in clinical practice and research.
The UAB-LSA and LSA-CI for community settings and the interview-based or proxy-based LSA-IS for institutional settings were found to be the most appropriate LSM questionnaires.
The current pandemic caused by COVID-19 has underlined the importance of a joint effort and approach to ensure patient and health care worker safety in medical care throughout Europe.
In addition, the recent flood disasters in Germany and other countries called for immediate joint action, in this case with regard to the prevention of water-borne infections.
Environmental disasters will increase with consequences for hospitals and nursing homes.
Cooperative efforts are needed for preventing and controlling associated infection outbreaks, new pathogens will appear and a geographic shift of infectious diseases previously not detected in certain areas has already been observed.
This approach to infection prevention and control must entail structural as well as regulatory aspects.
The principle of equal protection against infections in all European countries must be implemented.
Prevention and control of infections, including nosocomial infections, infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria as well as pandemics, need to be based on equal standards in all of Europe.
Protection against infections and other public health risks in all European countries is the best guarantor for building trust and identification of citizens in our common Europe.
Experts in the fields of hygiene, microbiology, infectiology and epidemiology have to pool the expertise on the prevention and control of infections from different European countries and define key targets for achieving a high standard of hygiene measures throughout Europe.
The participants of the Rudolf Schülke Foundation International Symposium call for immediate action and priority to be given to the realization of the proposed 16-point plan.
Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is a widely used cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique to diagnose a broad range of ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies.
Since its development and validation against histology already more than two decades ago, the clinical utility of LGE and its span of applications have increased considerably.
In this review we will present the basic concepts of LGE imaging and its diagnostic and prognostic value, elaborate on recent developments and emerging methods, and finally discuss future prospects.
An orthodontic app named 'Labkhand' was designed by a team of orthodontists and programmers according to the needs and scheduled interventions for patients.
The aim of this app was to obviate the orthodontic needs of patients by providing educational content in the form of texts and videos, oral hygiene reminders, appointment reminders, and nutrition reminders.
It also enabled instant messaging and chatting between patients and dental personnel.
In this study, 61 patients were monitored during their orthodontic treatment procedure.
All patients were evaluated using a questionnaire with 7 questions before and after a 6-month treatment period.
A total of 31 patients were instructed to use the app, while the other 30 patients received treatment without the app.
The collected data were analyzed using paired t‑test and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) test.
While the control group's questionnaire score remained almost the same (P > 0.05), the mean questionnaire score of patients in the intervention group significantly increased after using the app compared to the baseline scores acquired before using the app (P < 0.001).
The greatest improvement was noted in topics related to 'reminding of appointments', 'general information about orthodontic treatment', and 'oral hygiene maintenance and instructions'. 'Quality of services' and 'patient-orthodontist communication' showed the least improvement in patient satisfaction.
The Labkhand orthodontic app has multiple functions and can obviate the needs of orthodontic patients easily and at a low cost.
The aim of this article is to introduce a new robotic-assisted approach in UKA to TKA revision arthroplasty and investigate the alignment accuracy, implant component use and surgery time and to compare it to primary robotic-assisted TKA arthroplasty.
This retrospective, case-control study included patients undergoing image-less robotic-assisted revision arthroplasty from UKA to TKA (n = 20) and patients undergoing image-less robotic-assisted primary TKA (control group, n = 20) from 11/2018 to 07/2020.
The control group was matched based on the BMI and natural alignment.
Comparison of groups was based on postoperative alignment, outlier rate, tibial insert size, lateral bone resection depth, incision-to-wound closure time.
All surgeries were performed by a single senior surgeon using the same bi-cruciate stabilizing TKA system.
Statistical analysis consisted of parametric t‑testing and Fisher's exact test with a level of significance of p < 0.05.
The two groups showed no differences in mean BMI, natural alignment (p > 0.05) and mean overall limb alignment.
The incision to wound closure time was longer in the revision group but showed no significant difference.
Image-less robotic-assisted revision arthroplasty from UKA to TKA showed a comparable surgery time, and alignment accuracy in comparison to primary robotic-assisted TKA.
Comparable bone preservation and subsequent tibial insert size use was observed for both groups.
As a consequence of the Swedish model, endoprosthesis registers have become increasingly important worldwide.
Due to the increasing number of joint replacements at the shoulder, these are being increasingly included in the register databases - in addition to interventions at the hip and knee joint.
In this study, the value of endoprosthesis registers is investigated, using the example of shoulder endoprosthetics and including a comparison with clinical studies.
The number of operations and demographic patient data for all areas of endoprosthetics were examined.
In addition, a more detailed consideration of variables such as the primary diagnosis, the cause of the revision, the revision rate depending on risk factors and patient-reported outcome measures (PROM scores) was carried out exclusively for the shoulder joint endoprostheses.
Using the example of the inverse shoulder prosthesis, clinical studies were compared to registry data with special regard to the revision rate.
A total of 20 endoprosthesis registers could be included, 9 of these collected data on shoulder arthroplasty.
The main primary diagnoses were osteoarthritis (40.6%), rotator cuff defect arthropathy (30.2%) and fractures (17.6%).
The most commonly used shoulder joint endoprosthesis was the inverse prosthesis (47.3%).
The proportion of revision surgeries in total shoulder arthroplasty operations was less than 10% in all registers.
In addition to the revision rate, the PROM scores were sometimes used in the registers to evaluate the success of the prosthesis.
Compared to registry data, clinical studies showed more heterogeneous data with a significantly higher revision rate of over 10% in long-term follow-up - using the example of the inverse shoulder prosthesis.
Register data are a valuable source of information in shoulder arthroplasty and can make a significant contribution to the quality assurance of endoprosthetic treatments.
Compared to clinical studies, they primarily provide data on durability of different endoprosthesis and give lower revision rates.
Clinical studies use PROM scores and clinical and radiological examinations to focus only on individual implants and surgical centres on the one hand and much more on the functional results on the other.
Platelet activation by RA may contribute to no-reflow, and the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to test the effect of RA on white thrombus could confirm platelet activation indirectly.
We analyzed 53 consecutive patients with severely calcified lesions on coronary angiography.
All patients were examined with OCT.
In total, 20 patients who received RA and for whom OCT imaging was performed before and after RA and stent implantation comprised the RA group.
The remaining 33 patients formed the control group, for whom OCT imaging was performed before balloon dilatation and after stent implantation.
The patients in the RA group were older and had a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus.
In the control group, there was no thrombogenesis during the procedure, whereas in the RA group, all the target vessels had white thrombi on OCT after RA.
The average number of white thrombi per lesion after RA was 7.23 ± 4.4, and the average length of white thrombus was 0.51 ± 0.33 mm.
Statistical analysis with Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that thrombus load was related to burr size (r = 0.575, p = 0.040) and number of rotations (r = 0.599, p = 0.031).
White thrombi during RA can be verified by performing OCT.
Treating calcified lesions with RA may enhance thrombogenesis.
These data suggest using appropriate therapy to avoid no-reflow during RA.
The aim of the present bibliometric study was to record the focus of publications, type of study and publication activities depending on the hierarchy level and gender of the authors of German university departments for orthopaedic surgery.
The publication performance of the staff surgeons, consisting of chief and senior physicians, section and division heads of 39 German university departments of orthopaedic surgery university hospitals, was recorded over a period of 10 years (January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019).
All publications were considered that were listed in PubMed and for which the staff surgeons were first or last authors.
In addition, the impact factor (IF) and the h-index were determined.
1739 (39.2%) publications were compiled by 180 staff surgeons of university departments for trauma surgery and 2699 (60.8%) publications by 343 surgeons in departments of orthopaedics and trauma surgery.
Most publications were related to injuries or impairments of the lower extremity including the hip (n = 1626; 38.1%), followed by the upper extremity (n = 737; 17.3%).
These publications focussed on diagnostic testing (25.5%), surgical techniques (19.1%) or special osteosyntheses (16.9%).
The highest average IF per publication was achieved by publications on plastics (IF 2.02), on outcome (IF 1.96) and on diagnostic testing (IF 1.93).
Heads of departments were first authors in 18.8%, senior physicians with management functions in 40.7% and senior physicians without management functions in 69% of papers and last authors in 81.2%, 49.3% and 31.0% of articles, respectively.
64 of 523 staff surgeons (12.2%) were women.
306 authors (6.1%) were women, corresponding to 4.8 authorships per female surgeon - significantly for male surgeons (10.3 authorships per male surgeon).
In the present study, among senior physicians with a management function, the share of publishing surgeons was 59.1% for women, but 85.5% for men. In contrast, in the group of senior physicians without management function female and male surgeons were almost equally represented (57.5% vs. 60.5%).
It must therefore be asked whether the work life balance is more difficult to meet for women than for men with longer careers.
Mentoring programs are required to support the publication activities of the increasing number of female applicants in the future.
The embryonic and fetal development of the orbit comprises a series of sequential events, starting with the fertilization of the ovum and extending until birth.
Most of the publications dealing with orbital morphogenesis describe the sequential development of each germinal layer, the ectoderm with its neuroectoderm derivative and the mesoderm.
This approach provides a clear understanding of the mode of development of each layer but does not give the reader a general picture of the structure of the orbit within any specified time frame.
In order to enhance our understanding of the developmental anatomy of the orbit, the authors have summarized the recent developments in orbital morphogenesis, a temporally precise and morphogenetically intricate process.
Understanding this multidimensional process of development in prenatal life, identifying and linking signaling cascades, as well as the regulatory genes linked to existing diseases, may pave the way for advanced molecular diagnostic testing, developing minimally invasive interventions, and the use of progenitor/stem cell and even regenerative therapy.
In late 2020, as soon as the approval of the first vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became foreseeable in line with the normative political goal of providing comparable living conditions to all residents of Germany irrespective of where they live, the German national government's national vaccination strategy called for the widespread establishment of COVID-19 vaccination centers.
As the vaccination program has been rolled out, difficulties in accessing vaccination centers have been reported. Against this background, the paper considers the questions whether, where and for whom spatial inequalities in COVID-19 vaccination center accessibility in Germany might exist.
Such an understanding might help to prepare for future situations when adequate disaster response requires, similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government to quickly reach great parts of the population in an efficient manner.
To approach this question, we examine the accessibility by the means of transport foot, bicycle, car and public transport at small scale based on an accessibility model from the point of view of the 'households'.
We found that in contrast to the common belief COVID-19 vaccination center accessibility or inaccessibility in Germany does not seem to be a spatial phenomenon cheating non-rural regions and discriminating rural regions as anticipated, it is instead strongly dependent on people's individual mobility capabilities in both rural and urban areas.
We performed a retrospective cohort study to evaluate demographic data, clinical findings, growth and pubertal characteristics, and medical treatment of 83 OI patients. 83 (31 female/52 male) patients were enrolled in the study.
The median follow-up duration was 4.7 (0.6-17.7) years.
51 out of 83 patients (61.4%) received bisphosphonate therapy.
The median Z-score of the bone mineral density improved in patients with OI-I and OI-III with the treatment.
During follow-up, height-SDS significantly increased in both OI-I and OI-III on treatment; however, final adult height SDS of patients did not improve.
The frequency of overweight and obesity was found to be increased at the last evaluation compared to the admission.
The rate of precocious puberty (PP) and early puberty (EP) were 20 and 10% in girls, and they were 15.7 and 47.3% in boys, respectively.
Reduced growth, significant weight gain over time due to impaired mobility, and high frequency of PP/EP require effective interventions to improve mobility and functional parameters as early as possible in children with OI.
This study included patients who underwent flexible ureteroscopy for the treatment of renal stones in our centre between 2015 and 2020.
Patients who underwent any surgical procedure on the ipsilateral ureter and had a history of spontaneous stone passage were excluded.
Patients were divided into two groups based on UAS insertion success (group 1) or failure (group 2).
Both groups were compared with a view to clinical characteristics, preoperative neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte and platelet counts and ratios of these counts, all being considered inflammatory markers.
A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the independent variables affecting UAS insertion success.
There were 113 (59.1%) patients in group 1, while group 2 consisted of 78 (40.9%) patients.
The rates of male gender, coronary artery disease and preoperative ipsilateral hydronephrosis were significantly higher in group 2, while platelet counts and platelet-lymphocyte ratios were significantly lower.
Our results suggest that male gender and ipsilateral hydronephrosis are associated with increased UAS insertion failure.
Although we found a relationship between relatively low platelet levels and UAS insertion failure, we think that further studies are needed to investigate this matter.
In order to prevent implant failure and secondary fracture dislocation, it is often recommended that patients perform partial weight-bearing after surgery of the lower extremity.
Previous examinations showed that patients are often not able to follow these instructions.
In this study, patients who had undergone surgery of the lower extremity were studied in order to analyze whether incorrect loading influenced the number and severity of complications. Fifty-one patients were equipped with electronic shoe insoles, which measure loading and other parameters.
The measurement period was 24 to 102 hours. Median duration of follow-up was 490 days.
The primary outcome parameter was postoperative complications leading to revision surgery.
Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square and Fisher exact tests with significance set at a p < 0.05.
Seven out of fifty-one patients had postoperative complications. Four wound complications, one implant failure, chronic instability after fracture of the tibia, and one implant loosening of a hip prosthesis were recorded.
Most of the patients were unable to follow the surgeon's instructions for partial weight-bearing.
Excessive loading did not seem to influence the number and severity of postoperative complications, especially regarding implant failure.
Therefore, we should continue with measurements and reevaluate the 'partial weight-bearing doctrine'.
Ecologically relevant factors such as exercise and diet quality can directly influence how physiological systems work including those involved in maintaining oxidative balance; however, to our knowledge, no studies to date have focused on how such factors directly affect expression of key components of the endogenous antioxidant system (i.e., transcription factors, select antioxidant genes, and corresponding antioxidant enzymes) in several metabolically active tissues of a migratory songbird.
We conducted a three-factor experiment that tested the following hypotheses: (H1) Daily flying over several weeks increases the expression of transcription factors NRF2 and PPARs as well as endogenous antioxidant genes (i.e., CAT, SOD1, SOD2, GPX1, GPX4), and upregulates endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities (i.e., CAT, SOD, GPx).
(H2) Songbirds fed diets composed of more 18:2n-6 PUFA are more susceptible to oxidative damage and thus upregulate their endogenous antioxidant system compared with when fed diets with less PUFA.
(H3) Songbirds fed dietary anthocyanins gain additional antioxidant protection and thus upregulate their endogenous antioxidant system less compared with songbirds not fed anthocyanins.
Dietary fat quality had no effect on antioxidant pathways (H2), whereas dietary anthocyanins increased the expression of select antioxidant enzymes in the pectoralis, but not in the liver (H3).
What remains to be demonstrated is how the extent of these ecological factors (i.e., intensity or duration of flight, amounts of dietary antioxidants) influences the regulation of these antioxidant pathways and thus oxidative balance.
Pemphigus vulgaris is a rare immune-mediated skin disorder of the dog, usually treated with immunosuppressive medications such as oral glucocorticoids, azathioprine or ciclosporin.
Herein we report the successful treatment of pemphigus vulgaris in a dog, using oclacitinib and a topical product containing fucidic acid (0.5 % w/w) and betamethasone valerate.
To investigate the role of inflammatory markers in predicting the spontaneous passage of ureteral stones.
We retrospectively reviewed 279 patients with ureteral stones sized 4-10 mm that were managed conservatively.
The mean age of the patients was 41.2 years.
The patients in Group 1 had a significantly lower mean stone size, white blood cell count and neutrophil count.
In addition, stone location, presence of hydronephrosis and history of urolithiasis were significantly different between the groups.
In a multivariate analysis, stone size, distal location and hydronephrosis status significantly predicted the spontaneous stone passage.
However, inflammatory markers including white blood cell count, neutrophil count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio could not determine the likelihood of spontaneous stone passage.
Our results suggest that inflammatory markers are no meaningful parameters for the prediction of spontaneous stone passage.
Cutaneous horn is a skin disease with low incidence and few citations in the literature.
This report describes a dog with multiple cutaneous lesions of papillomatosis and one giant cutaneous horn on the face.
Two sessions of cryotherapy achieved complete remission of the lesions.
Life-space mobility (LSM), as the extent of mobility within one's environment, is a key for successful aging and has become a relevant concept in gerontology and geriatric research.
Adequate assessment instruments are needed to identify older persons with LSM restrictions, and to initiate, adapt or evaluate intervention strategies.
To systematically identify, describe and analyze the psychometric properties of LSM questionnaires, with a special focus on their availability in the German language.
A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Web of Science.
Studies that examined at least one psychometric property of LSM questionnaires published up to August 2021 were included and evaluated based on the consensus-based standards for the selection of health measurement instruments (COSMIN) guidelines.

Methodological quality and comprehensiveness of validations were heterogeneous.
Based on comprehensive and high-quality results, four LSM questionnaires stood out: the University of Alabama at Birmingham life-space assessment (UAB-LSA), life-space assessment in persons with cognitive impairment (LSA-CI), interview-based and proxy-based versions of the life-space assessment in institutionalized settings (LSA-IS), all of them available in the German language.
This systematic review provides a concise overview of available LSM questionnaires and their psychometric properties to facilitate the selection for use in clinical practice and research.
The UAB-LSA and LSA-CI for community settings and the interview-based or proxy-based LSA-IS for institutional settings were found to be the most appropriate LSM questionnaires.

Transanal protrusion of intussusception (TAPI; also known as prolapsed intussusception) is a rare complication.
Here, we present a successful colonoscopic reduction of ileocolic intussusception presented with transanal prolapse.
An 8‑month male child, weighing 8 kg, was referred to our hospital presenting with a mass in his anal canal, diarrhea and rectal bleeding for two days.
The sonographic evaluation revealed an ileocolic intussusception in the rectosigmoid area.
The patient was treated using colonoscopic reduction.
To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting colonoscopic reduction for transanal prolapsed intussusceptions.
Our study suggests gastroenterologists to consider colonoscopy as a therapeutic method for prolapsed intussusceptions and encourages them to attempt reducing the invagination using this method before laparotomy, especially in cases presenting within 48 h of onset of symptoms and no peritonitis symptoms.
The treatment of complex injuries of the extremities after comminuted fractures or non-unions is a challenging area in the field of trauma surgery.
Internal, motorized implants nowadays enable a patient-oriented and progressive treatment of these cases.
The present article aims to present modern treatment strategies of complex injuries of the extremities, support the use of novel, motorized intramedullary nails and provide experiences for the handling with lengthening nails or transport nails.
For this purpose, the preoperative planning including selection of patients, presentation of internal lengthening and transport systems and the most important factors during preparation of the surgery are described.
Moreover, critical steps during the implantation of motorized nails and also during potential follow-up interventions are highlighted and the postoperative protocol including precise recommendations for the transport und consolidation phase are provided.
Finally, the experiences are illustrated by presentation of the four different cases.
The use of internal, motorized implants represents the latest step in the treatment of complex injuries of the extremities.
These implants improve the quality of life and the authors recommend its use.
However, these implants require a high expertise and adaption of established treatment protocols in these challenging trauma cases.
Follow-up analyses with a considerably large number of cases are necessary and the research on implants to solve persisting problems in the area of complex injuries of the extremities has to be pursued intensively.
Increased risk for thromboembolic events from combination of a gynecologic malignancy with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection: a case report
Purpose: During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic, several patient groups are at particular risk.
Mortality is higher among cancer patients and may be increased further by thromboembolic events, which are more common in coronavirus 2019 patients according to recent publications.
We discuss the association of gynecologic malignancies, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and thromboembolism by reporting a case study and summarizing available literature.
Case report: A 71-year-old Caucasian patient with ovarian cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
Routine screening revealed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in absence of specific symptoms.
After uneventful recovery, oncologic treatment could be continued a few weeks later.
Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature on PubMed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.
The search included articles ahead of print, published between 1 December 2019 and 1 June 2020.
Cross-searches were conducted on all relevant articles.
Results: We identified five articles meeting the defined criteria, including two retrospective studies, a review, a position paper, as well as a letter to the editor.
Conclusion: Cancer patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have a relatively poor outcome, which may partially be due to a higher rate of thromboembolic events.
Thromboprophylaxis is recommended, and scoring systems are helpful in early detection.
In cancer patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, individual risk for thromboembolic events should be taken into account when considering interruption versus continuation of antitumoral therapy.
However, further data and studies are required.
A 71-year-old Caucasian woman, gravida 2/para 2, presented with pain in her lower left leg accompanied by progressive dyspnea in April 2020.
She had already received dabigatran prescribed by her general practitioner for suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) one day prior to her admittance.
The patient was undergoing multimodal treatment at our clinic for HGSOC FIGO IIIC.
Up to that point, she had received debulking surgery with macroscopic complete tumor resection in February 2020, including bilateral adnexectomy, hysterectomy, peritonectomy, infragastric omentectomy, pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy, partial liver resection, and rectosigmoid resection.
Secondary wound closure could be achieved after treatment of wound dehiscence in March 2020.
First-line chemotherapy was initiated with carboplatin AUC 5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks.
After completion of the first course, we switched to weekly application of carboplatin AUC 2 and paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 to improve tolerability.
Three weekly courses of chemotherapy were administered without complications.
Initiation of bevacizumab was postponed due to delayed wound healing.
The patient reported a general feeling of weakness since surgery but was otherwise in a good state of health.
Her medical history included papillary thyroid cancer, successfully treated in 2008 by total thyroidectomy, and catheter ablation of the AV node because of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia in 2015.
No other relevant cardiovascular or pulmonal diseases were known.
She had an uneventful gynecological and obstetrical history.
BRCA testing was negative, and there was no family history of gynecologic malignancies.
The patient did not smoke or drink alcohol regularly.
She was taking L-thyroxin, pantoprazole, and vitamin D as regular medication.
At current presentation, she was routinely asked for symptoms and risk factors for COVID-19 and negated symptoms such as fever, cough, headaches, loss of taste or smell, or recent international travel.
Her only contacts were close relatives as well as her general practitioner.
Clinical examination showed normal clinical conditions as well as normal vital functions (blood pressure 123/75 mmHg, temperature 36.9 °C, heart rate 87 /minute, oxygen saturation 98 %) but a slightly elevated respiratory rate (22 /minute).
Besides chronic anemia (hemoglobin 9.0 g/dl) and elevated infection parameters (C-reactive protein 8.1 mg/dl, ferritin 470 ng/ml), blood testing showed no relevant changes; especially, renal and hepatic function were normal.
Sonography revealed a mild urinary stasis on the left side.
For further diagnosis, we referred the patient to the angiology department of our clinic, where DVT of the left lower leg as well as a thrombophlebitis of the right great saphenous vein and venous thrombosis of the right gastrocnemius muscle vein were confirmed via color Duplex sonography.
We ordered chest computed tomography due to complaints of progressive dyspnea, revealing segmental PE in one central lung artery as well as in several subsegmental arteries (Fig. 1a).
No infiltrates, especially no changes typical for COVID-19, were seen (Fig. 1b).
We performed a nasopharyngeal swab as a routine screening test for SARS-CoV-2 upon hospitalization.
Surprisingly, it revealed infection with SARS-CoV-2 via reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on the following day.
The woman was therefore isolated and transferred to the infectiology department of our clinic, where she was treated for ten more days.
As the patient was in a stable cardiopulmonal condition with no signs of right heart overload in echocardiography, conservative treatment with low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) at a therapeutic dosage and compression stockings was continued.
Respiratory parameters were sufficient with no need for oxygen therapy or further medication at any time.
An incidental urinary tract infection with Klebsiella pneumonia was sufficiently treated with cefpodoxim 400 mg per day for 10 days.
A repeat PCR test before discharge was negative.
The patient was quarantined at home for 14 more days.
Anticoagulant treatment was continued with apixaban for 6 months.
No further thromboembolic events occurred meanwhile.
With a therapeutic gap of 5 weeks, we continued chemotherapy with the weekly regimen.
For the next 2 courses, dose reduction to 75% was performed; full doses of carboplatin AUC 2 and paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 were resumed thereafter and well tolerated.
A lymphocele of the left lower abdomen which had caused progressive urinary stasis was drained complication-free 5 months later.
As bevacizumab was contraindicated because of prior VTE, oncologic maintenance therapy with niraparib 200 mg per day followed afterwards.
A displaced anterior glenoid rim fracture, the so-called bony Bankart lesion, occurs after a traumatic shoulder dislocation resulting from a high energy trauma and is associated with recurrent shoulder instability.
Different surgical techniques have been described in the literature to address this pathology, including open reduction and fixation, as well as arthroscopic transosseous, and single-row or double-row approaches with the use of suture anchors.
However, there is currently no gold standard of treatment and the stability of fixation and the healing of the bony fragment are still a concern.
The purpose of this report was to introduce an arthroscopic independent double-row (IDR) bony Bankart repair technique for fixation of large glenoid fractures.
It is evident from the national joint registries that numbers of revision knee arthroplasty operations are rising.
The aim of this article is to introduce a new robotic-assisted approach in UKA to TKA revision arthroplasty and investigate the alignment accuracy, implant component use and surgery time and to compare it to primary robotic-assisted TKA arthroplasty.
This retrospective, case-control study included patients undergoing image-less robotic-assisted revision arthroplasty from UKA to TKA (n = 20) and patients undergoing image-less robotic-assisted primary TKA (control group, n = 20) from 11/2018 to 07/2020.
The control group was matched based on the BMI and natural alignment.
Comparison of groups was based on postoperative alignment, outlier rate, tibial insert size, lateral bone resection depth, incision-to-wound closure time.
All surgeries were performed by a single senior surgeon using the same bi-cruciate stabilizing TKA system.
Statistical analysis consisted of parametric t‑testing and Fisher's exact test with a level of significance of p < 0.05.
The two groups showed no differences in mean BMI, natural alignment (p > 0.05) and mean overall limb alignment.
No outlier was found for OLA and slope analysis.
The smallest insert size (9 mm) was used in 70% of the cases in the revision group (n = 14) and in 90% of the cases in the primary group (n = 18, p = 0.24), distal femoral and tibial resection depth showed no statistical difference (p > 0.05).
The incision to wound closure time was longer in the revision group but showed no significant difference.
Image-less robotic-assisted revision arthroplasty from UKA to TKA showed a comparable surgery time, and alignment accuracy in comparison to primary robotic-assisted TKA.
Comparable bone preservation and subsequent tibial insert size use was observed for both groups.
To investigate the relationship between failure to insert a ureteral access sheath (UAS) with inflammation and other clinical parameters in patients treated with flexible ureteroscopy for renal stones.
This study included patients who underwent flexible ureteroscopy for the treatment of renal stones in our centre between 2015 and 2020.
Patients who underwent any surgical procedure on the ipsilateral ureter and had a history of spontaneous stone passage were excluded.
Patients were divided into two groups based on UAS insertion success (group 1) or failure (group 2).
Both groups were compared with a view to clinical characteristics, preoperative neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte and platelet counts and ratios of these counts, all being considered inflammatory markers.
A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the independent variables affecting UAS insertion success.
There were 113 (59.1%) patients in group 1, while group 2 consisted of 78 (40.9%) patients.
The rates of male gender, coronary artery disease and preoperative ipsilateral hydronephrosis were significantly higher in group 2, while platelet counts and platelet-lymphocyte ratios were significantly lower.
Our analysis revealed four independent predictors for UAS insertion failure: female gender (odds ratio [OR]=2.1) increased the rate of UAS insertion success, while hydronephrosis (OR=1.6), low platelet counts and PLR increased the rate of UAS insertion failure (OR=0.99, OR=0.98, respectively).
Our results suggest that male gender and ipsilateral hydronephrosis are associated with increased UAS insertion failure.
Although we found a relationship between relatively low platelet levels and UAS insertion failure, we think that further studies are needed to investigate this matter.
This paper focuses on disability, an under-researched area of inequality, and subjective well-being.
According to social production function theory, people with a disability do not have the same opportunities as people without disabilities to obtain resources, instrumental goals, and ultimately subjective well-being.
Social participation and employment seem to be crucial mechanisms behind such disparities.
The social system of a country (macro level) also shapes the gap in subjective well-being between both groups.
The main objective of this paper is to analyse the gap in subjective well-being between people with and without disabilities.
How is this gap linked to social participation and labour market integration, and how does the welfare-state regime shape the gap in subjective well-being between people with and without disabilities? The core of this research are multilevel analyses of cumulative European Social Survey data from 31 European countries.
The results reveal that people with disabilities show significantly lower subjective well-being than people without disabilities.
Welfare-state regimes have an effect on this gap, with social-democratic (and family-oriented) Nordic countries performing best in providing equal living conditions for people with and without disabilities.
This narrative review sums up data from the SARS-CoV-2-pandemia on preexisting disease/underlying conditions/comorbidities and risk factors in children for severe COVID-19 and MIS-C/PIMS-TS as well as hospitalization and mortality.
Young infants and adolescents are at highest risk of hospital and PICU admission.
Two or more comorbidities rather than single entities pose a risk for more severe courses of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.
Asthma and malignancy do not increase complication rates.
MIS-C/PIMS-TS is not associated with any specific underlying disease.
Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is a widely used cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique to diagnose a broad range of ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies.
Since its development and validation against histology already more than two decades ago, the clinical utility of LGE and its span of applications have increased considerably.
In this review we will present the basic concepts of LGE imaging and its diagnostic and prognostic value, elaborate on recent developments and emerging methods, and finally discuss future prospects.
Continuous developments in 3 D imaging methods, motion correction techniques, water/fat-separated imaging, dark-blood methods, and scar quantification improved the performance and further expanded the clinical utility of LGE imaging. LGE imaging is the current noninvasive reference standard for the assessment of myocardial viability.
Improvements in spatial resolution, scar-to-blood contrast, and water/fat-separated imaging further strengthened its position. · LGE MRI is the reference standard for the noninvasive assessment of myocardial viability.
· LGE MRI is used to diagnose a broad range of non-ischemic cardiomyopathies in everyday clinical practice.. · Improvements in spatial resolution and scar-to-blood contrast further strengthened its position. · Continuous developments improve its performance and further expand its clinical utility.

To investigate reduction of radiation exposure in unenhanced CT in suspicion of renal calculi using a tin-filtered high tube voltage protocol compared to a standard low-dose protocol without spectral shaping.
A phantom study using 7 human renal calculi was performed to test both protocols.
120 consecutive unenhanced CT examinations performed due to suspicion of renal calculi were included in this retrospective, monocentric study.
60 examinations were included with the standard-dose protocol (SP) (100 kV/130 mAs), whereas another 60 studies were included using a low-dose protocol (LD) applying spectral shaping with tin filtration of high tube voltages (Sn150 kV/80 mAs).
Image quality was assessed by two radiologists in consensus blinded to technical parameters using an equidistant Likert scale ranging from 1-5 with 5 being the highest score.
Quantitative image quality was assessed using regions of interest in abdominal organs, muscles, and adipose tissue to analyze image noise and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).
Commercially available dosimetry software was used to determine and compare effective dose (ED) and size-specific dose estimates (SSDEmean).
All seven renal calculi of the phantom could be detected with both protocols.
There was no difference regarding calcluli size between the two protocols except for the smallest one.
The smallest concretion measured 1.5 mm in LD and 1.0 mm in SP (ground truth 1.5 mm).
CTDIvol was 3.36 mGy in LD (DLP: 119.3 mGycm) and 8.27 mGy in SP (DLP: 293.6 mGycm).
The mean patient age in SP was 47 ± 17 years and in LD 49 ± 13 years.
Ureterolithiasis was found in 33 cases in SP and 32 cases in LD.
The median concretion size was 3 mm in SP and 4 mm in LD.
The median ED in LD was 1.3 mSv (interquartile range (IQR) 0.3 mSv) compared to 2.3 mSv (IQR 0.9 mSv) in SP (p < 0.001).
The SSDEmean of LD was also significantly lower compared to SP with 2.4 mGy (IQR 0.4 mGy) vs. 4.8 mGy (IQR 2.3 mGy) (p < 0.001).
The SNR was significantly lower in LD compared to SP (p < 0.001).
However, there was no significant difference between SP and LD regarding the qualitative assessment of image quality with a median of 4 (IQR 1) for both groups (p = 0.648).
Tin-filtered unenhanced abdominal CT for the detection of renal calculi using high tube voltages leads to a significant reduction of radiation exposure and yields high diagnostic image quality without a significant difference compared to the institution's standard of care low-dose protocol without tin filtration.
· Tin-filtered CT for the detection of renal calculi significantly reduces radiation dose.. · The application of tin filtration provides comparable diagnostic image quality to that of SP protocols.. · An increase in image noise does not hamper diagnostic image quality.. · Gassenmaier S, Winkelmann MT, Magnus J et al.

As a consequence of the Swedish model, endoprosthesis registers have become increasingly important worldwide.
Due to the increasing number of joint replacements at the shoulder, these are being increasingly included in the register databases - in addition to interventions at the hip and knee joint.
In this study, the value of endoprosthesis registers is investigated, using the example of shoulder endoprosthetics and including a comparison with clinical studies.
The annual reports of 32 different endoprosthesis registers with data on hip, knee and/or shoulder arthroplasty were analysed.
The number of operations and demographic patient data for all areas of endoprosthetics were examined.
In addition, a more detailed consideration of variables such as the primary diagnosis, the cause of the revision, the revision rate depending on risk factors and patient-reported outcome measures (PROM scores) was carried out exclusively for the shoulder joint endoprostheses.
Using the example of the inverse shoulder prosthesis, clinical studies were compared to registry data with special regard to the revision rate.
A total of 20 endoprosthesis registers could be included, 9 of these collected data on shoulder arthroplasty.
The main primary diagnoses were osteoarthritis (40.6%), rotator cuff defect arthropathy (30.2%) and fractures (17.6%).
The most commonly used shoulder joint endoprosthesis was the inverse prosthesis (47.3%).
The proportion of revision surgeries in total shoulder arthroplasty operations was less than 10% in all registers.
In addition to the revision rate, the PROM scores were sometimes used in the registers to evaluate the success of the prosthesis.
Compared to registry data, clinical studies showed more heterogeneous data with a significantly higher revision rate of over 10% in long-term follow-up - using the example of the inverse shoulder prosthesis.
Register data are a valuable source of information in shoulder arthroplasty and can make a significant contribution to the quality assurance of endoprosthetic treatments.
Compared to clinical studies, they primarily provide data on durability of different endoprosthesis and give lower revision rates.
Clinical studies use PROM scores and clinical and radiological examinations to focus only on individual implants and surgical centres on the one hand and much more on the functional results on the other.
Ecologically relevant factors such as exercise and diet quality can directly influence how physiological systems work including those involved in maintaining oxidative balance; however, to our knowledge, no studies to date have focused on how such factors directly affect expression of key components of the endogenous antioxidant system (i.e., transcription factors, select antioxidant genes, and corresponding antioxidant enzymes) in several metabolically active tissues of a migratory songbird.
We conducted a three-factor experiment that tested the following hypotheses: (H1) Daily flying over several weeks increases the expression of transcription factors NRF2 and PPARs as well as endogenous antioxidant genes (i.e., CAT, SOD1, SOD2, GPX1, GPX4), and upregulates endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities (i.e., CAT, SOD, GPx).
(H2) Songbirds fed diets composed of more 18:2n-6 PUFA are more susceptible to oxidative damage and thus upregulate their endogenous antioxidant system compared with when fed diets with less PUFA.
(H3) Songbirds fed dietary anthocyanins gain additional antioxidant protection and thus upregulate their endogenous antioxidant system less compared with songbirds not fed anthocyanins.
Flight training increased the expression of 3 of the 6 antioxidant genes and transcription factors measured in the liver, consistent with H1, but for only one gene (SOD2) in the pectoralis.
Dietary fat quality had no effect on antioxidant pathways (H2), whereas dietary anthocyanins increased the expression of select antioxidant enzymes in the pectoralis, but not in the liver (H3).
These tissue-specific differences in response to flying and dietary antioxidants are likely explained by functional differences between tissues as well as fundamental differences in their turnover rates.
The consumption of dietary antioxidants along with regular flying enables birds during migration to stimulate the expression of genes involved in antioxidant protection likely through increasing the transcriptional activity of NRF2 and PPARs, and thereby demonstrates for the first time that these relevant ecological factors affect the regulation of key antioxidant pathways in wild birds.
What remains to be demonstrated is how the extent of these ecological factors (i.e., intensity or duration of flight, amounts of dietary antioxidants) influences the regulation of these antioxidant pathways and thus oxidative balance.
To assess the prognostic power of quantitative analysis of chest CT, laboratory values, and their combination in COVID-19 pneumonia.
Retrospective analysis of patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and chest CT performed between March 07 and November 13, 2020.
Volume and percentage (PO) of lung opacifications and mean HU of the whole lung were quantified using prototype software.
13 laboratory values were collected.
Negative outcome was defined as death, ICU admittance, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
Positive outcome was defined as care in the regular ward or discharge.
Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of CT parameters and laboratory values.
Independent predictors were combined to establish a scoring system for prediction of prognosis.
This score was validated on a separate validation cohort.
89 patients were included for model development between March 07 and April 27, 2020 (mean age: 60.3 years). 38 patients experienced a negative outcome.
In univariate regression analysis, all quantitative CT parameters as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), relative lymphocyte count (RLC), troponin, and LDH were associated with a negative outcome.
In a multivariate regression analysis, PO, CRP, and RLC were independent predictors of a negative outcome.
Combination of these three values showed a strong predictive value with a C-index of 0.87.
A scoring system was established which categorized patients into 4 groups with a risk of 7 %, 30 %, 67 %, or 100 % for a negative outcome.
The validation cohort consisted of 28 patients between May 5 and November 13, 2020.
A negative outcome occurred in 6 % of patients with a score of 0, 50 % with a score of 1, and 100 % with a score of 2 or 3.
The combination of PO, CRP, and RLC showed a high predictive value for a negative outcome.
A 4-point scoring system based on these findings allows easy risk stratification in the clinical routine and performed exceptionally in the validation cohort. · A high PO is associated with an unfavorable outcome in COVID-19.
· PO, CRP, and RLC are independent predictors of an unfavorable outcome, and their combination has strong predictive power. · A 4-point scoring system based on these values allows quick risk stratification in a clinical setting. · Scharf G, Meiler S, Zeman F et al.

Mastocytosis is a clonal hematopoietic disorder characterized by proliferation of abnormal mast cells in various organs including the skin, digestive system, lymph nodes, and bone marrow.
We report on a 75-year-old woman presenting with abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, and weight loss.
Abdominal CT showed hepatosplenomegaly with heterogeneous splenic parenchyma, lymphadenopathy, and osteopenia with areas of osteosclerosis but no primary tumour.
An <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT revealed an overall low metabolic activity of the lesions with a diffuse bone marrow involvement raising suspicion of a haematological neoplasm.
Subsequently, bone marrow and peripheral blood examinations confirmed the diagnosis of aggressive systemic mastocytosis.
Pemphigus vulgaris is a rare immune-mediated skin disorder of the dog, usually treated with immunosuppressive medications such as oral glucocorticoids, azathioprine or ciclosporin.
Herein we report the successful treatment of pemphigus vulgaris in a dog, using oclacitinib and a topical product containing fucidic acid (0.5 % w/w) and betamethasone valerate.
To investigate the role of inflammatory markers in predicting the spontaneous passage of ureteral stones.
We retrospectively reviewed 279 patients with ureteral stones sized 4-10 mm that were managed conservatively.
The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 consisted of 137 patients who passed the stone spontaneously; Group 2 comprised 142 patients without spontaneous stone passage.
The groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests. In addition, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the significance of the parameters.
The mean age of the patients was 41.2 years.
The patients in Group 1 had a significantly lower mean stone size, white blood cell count and neutrophil count.
In addition, stone location, presence of hydronephrosis and history of urolithiasis were significantly different between the groups.
Neutrophil percentage, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio were insignificantly lower in Group 1.
In a multivariate analysis, stone size, distal location and hydronephrosis status significantly predicted the spontaneous stone passage.
However, inflammatory markers including white blood cell count, neutrophil count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio could not determine the likelihood of spontaneous stone passage.
Our results suggest that inflammatory markers are no meaningful parameters for the prediction of spontaneous stone passage.
Hemostasis is a complex and tightly regulated system that attempts to maintain a homeostatic balance to permit normal blood flow, without bleeding or thrombosis.
Hemostasis reflects the subtle balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant factors in the pathways of primary hemostasis, secondary hemostasis, and fibrinolysis.
The major components in this interplay include the vascular endothelium, platelets, coagulation factors, and fibrinolytic factors.
After vessel wall injury, the subendothelium is exposed to the blood stream, followed by rapid activation of platelets via collagen binding and von Willebrand factor-mediated platelet adhesion to the damaged vessel wall through platelet glycoprotein receptor Ib/IX/V. Activated platelets change their shape, release bioactive molecules from their granules, and expose negatively charged phospholipids on their surface.
For a proper function of this process, an adequate number of functional platelets are required.
Subsequently, a rapid generation of sufficient amounts of thrombin begins; followed by activation of the coagulation system and its coagulation factors (secondary hemostasis), generating fibrin that consolidates the platelet plug.
To maintain equilibrium between coagulation and anticoagulation, the naturally occurring anticoagulants such as protein C, protein S, and antithrombin keep this process in balance.
Deficiencies (inherited or acquired) at any level of this fine-tuned system result in pathologic bleedings or increased hypercoagulability states leading to thrombosis.
This review will focus on genetic diagnosis of inherited bleeding, thrombotic, and platelet disorders, discussing strengths and limitations of existing diagnostic settings and genetic tools and highlight some important considerations necessary for clinical application.
The aim of this study was to investigate clinical characters and prognosis of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and severe pneumonia admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
We conducted a retrospective study that reviewed all clinical records of patients with SLE and severe pneumonia admitted to the ICU between 2008 and 2020.
A total of 86 SLE patients with severe pneumonia during their first ICU admission were enrolled in this study.
Most patients were female (n = 71, 82.5%), and the median age was 42.3 ± 14.7 years.
The most common organisms were gram-positive bacteria (20.9%), followed by gram-negative bacteria (18.6%) and fungi (10.4%).
A total of 31 patients died within 30 days of ICU admission, and the 30-day mortality was 36%.
In binary logistic regression analysis, Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and mechanical ventilation were dependently associated with 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] 2.97, P = 0.016; OR = 4.02, P = 0.023; OR = 1.52, P = 0.036; respectively).
Among the other 55 patients, 5 patients died after discharge from the ICU during the long-term follow-up.
Mortality was high in SLE patients with severe pneumonia admitted to the ICU, and most of the patients died within 30 days of ICU admission.
Complete heart block ensuing from a metastatic small cell carcinoma: a case report
Introduction: Notwithstanding the diagnostic and therapeutic advancements, the incidence of cardiac metastases has increased in recent decades.
Lung cancers are the most common primary malignant neoplasms with cardiac metastasis potential.
The clinical presentation of cardiac metastases is either silent or vague, and largely depends on the infiltrated location and tumor burden.
Although arrhythmias are not uncommon in metastatic cardiac tumors, complete heart block is relatively a rare manifestation.
We present a case of complete heart block due to a metastatic small cell carcinoma in a 67-year-old male of African origin.
Case presentation: A 67-year-old male of African origin from rural Tanzania was referred to us for expert management.
He is a retired agromechanic with over 30 years exposure to asbestos-containing brake linings.
His past medical history was unremarkable, but the family-social history was evident for a heavy alcohol intake and chronic cigarette smoking.
He presented with a 24-week history of progressive shortness of breath and an 8-week history of recurrent syncopal attacks coupled with a significant weight loss.
He had normal echocardiographic findings, however, the electrocardiogram showed features of complete heart block.
Chest X-ray showed a homogeneous opacification on the right side and computed tomography scan revealed a solid right lung mass with metastases to the liver, heart, bowels, and bone.
He underwent bronchoscopy, which revealed an endobronchial mass obstructing the bronchus intermedius.
Histological examination of a section of lung biopsy taken during bronchoscopy confirmed the diagnosis of a small cell carcinoma.
The patient underwent dual chamber pacemaker implantation with successful sinus rhythm restoration.
He made an informed refusal of chemotherapy and inevitably died 18 months post pacing.
Conclusions: Despite the advancements in medical diagnostics and management, lung cancers are often diagnosed in advanced stages, with an inevitable grave prognosis.
Small cell carcinoma has the potential to metastasize to the heart, resulting in complete heart block.
A 67-year-old male of African origin from the Kilimanjaro region north of Tanzania was referred to us for expert management.
He is a retired agromechanic with over 30 years exposure to asbestos-containing brake linings.
His past medical history was unremarkable, but the family-social history was evident for a heavy alcohol intake (5 units/day) and chronic cigarette smoking (20 pack years).
He presented with a 24-week history of progressive shortness of breath and an 8-week history of recurrent syncopal attacks.
Such complaints were associated with awareness of heart beat, easy fatigability, light headedness, dry cough, and weight loss (∼15 kg in 6 months).
There was a negative history of fever, night sweats, chest pain, visual disturbances, recurrent headaches, bone pain, vomiting, or diarrhea.
General examination revealed a wasted (BMI 17.6 kg/m2) man.
He had a sinus bradycardia of 32 beats/minute and blood pressure of 117/66 mmHg on cardiovascular examination.
Respiratory examination revealed features suggestive of right lung consolidation.
Other systems were essentially normal.
He underwent a number of hematological, biochemical, and serological tests, which revealed a normocytic normochromic anemia [hemoglobin (Hb) 11.1 g/dL] but otherwise normal.
His echocardiography (ECHO) was essentially normal, however the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed features in keeping with the diagnosis of CHB, Fig. 1.
Chest X-ray (CXR) showed a homogeneous opacification on the right side, and CT scan revealed a solid right lung mass with metastases to the heart, liver, bowels, and bone; Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
Furthermore, he underwent bronchoscopy, which revealed an endobronchial mass occluding the bronchus intermedius.
Histological examination of a section of lung biopsy taken during bronchoscopy confirmed the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma, Fig. 7.
Correspondingly, a histological section of heart muscle tissue revealed similar findings to lung biopsy.
The patient underwent dual chamber pacemaker implantation with successful sinus rhythm restoration.
He made an informed refusal of chemotherapy and inevitably died in his home village 18 months post pacing.
We received the death information from his son via a phone call, and an autopsy was not practical.
Intracystic papillary carcinoma in a male as a rare presentation of breast cancer: a case report and literature review
Introduction: The term "intracystic papillary ductal carcinoma in situ" has recently changed and is now more appropriately referred to "intracystic papillary carcinoma".
Intracystic papillary carcinoma in men is an extremely rare disease with only a few case presentations published in the literature so far.
Case presentation: We discuss a case of a 44-year-old Caucasian man with an intracystic papillary carcinoma treated with simple mastectomy, sentinel lymph-node biopsy and contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy.
These were followed by adjuvant radiotherapy of the breast.
Conclusion: Triple assessment (i.e. clinical examination and radiological and histological assessment) with a high level of clinical suspicion is necessary to diagnose intracystic papillary carcinoma in men due to its rarity.
Furthermore, genetic testing and risk-reducing mastectomy should also be considered in cases of a strong family history for male breast cancer.
A 44-year-old Caucasian man presented to the breast clinic with a 3-week history of a swelling in his left breast.
He also had a significant family history for breast cancer including a maternal grandmother, two of his maternal aunts and a maternal first cousin diagnosed with breast cancer.
On examination, a well-circumscribed, 2.5 cm swelling was palpable within an area of gynecomastia on the left chest wall.
Sonographically, a cystic mass with internal echoes was present without posterior acoustic shadowing.
Aspiration of the lesion revealed uniformly blood-stained fluid and a residual swelling persisted.
Cytology analysis of the aspirate confirmed the presence of atypical cells.
Mammography showed a circumscribed mass in the sub-areolar region of the left breast with partially obscured margins.
An irregular outline was noted on cranio-caudal view, but no spiculation or suspicious internal micro-calcifications were found.
A core biopsy of the lesion revealed atypical ductal hyperplasia, but no evidence of malignancy was seen.
In view of the atypical cells and residual swelling the lesion was excised.
Histological analysis revealed a lesion 2.5 cm × 1.8 cm × 1.2 cm in size.
The lesion comprised a papillary and solid proliferation of atypical cells within a large cystic space with a thick fibrous capsule (Figures 1, 2, 3) Haemorrhage was also noted within the cyst with changes consistent with the prior biopsy.
The margins were clear; there was no evidence of stromal or fibrovascular invasion.
The lesion displayed features of papillary DCIS and a diagnosis of intracystic papillary DCIS was made.
Immunohistochemistry showed oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positivity.
Completion left mastectomy with sentinel lymph-node mapping was carried out.
Contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy was also performed in view of the strong family history for breast cancer.
No evidence of further disease was detected in the mammary tissue and the sentinel node was clear.
Adjuvant radiotherapy (40 Gy in 25 fractions) was advised due to tumour extension close to deep margin.
Due to his significant family history for breast cancer, genetic testing was offered.
Breast-cancer gene 2 (BRCA2) mutation had been identified in a maternal aunt recently on the exon 24 insertion called c9481_9482insA.
It was very likely that this patient was a carrier of this BRCA2 mutation, which poses a small risk for him to develop prostate cancer.
He was therefore advised to undergo prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood testing on a yearly basis.
Increasing numbers of patients surviving malignant bone tumors around the knee joint have led to an increasing importance to investigate long-term results.
This study assessed the long-term results of rotationplasty after resection of malignant bone tumors regarding functional outcome and quality of life to allow better comparison with other treatment options in bone cancer treatment.
60 participants who underwent rotationplasty due to bone cancer took part in this multicentric questionnaire-based study.
The long-term functional outcome was measured by the Musculoskeletal tumor society score (MSTS) and the Tegner activity level scale.
The health-related quality of life (HRQL) was assessed by using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).
Patients treated with rotationplasty (median follow-up of 22 years, range 10-47 years) regained a high level of activity (median MSTS score of 24).
Even a return to high level sports was possible (mean Tegner activity level scale of 4).
Duration of follow-up did not influence the functional outcome.
HRQL scores were comparable to the general German population.
Concerns of psychological problems due to the unusual appearance of the rotated foot have not been confirmed.
Rotationplasty can be a good alternative to endoprosthetic replacement or amputation, either as primary surgery or as a salvage procedure.
Especially for growing children and very active patients rotationplasty should be considered.
Patellofemoral problems after total knee arthroplast (TKA) are frequent and often associated with a change in the geometry of the trochlear groove.
The present study aimed to analyze the feasibility of intraoperative examination of the patellofemoral joint geometry before and after the implantation of bicondylar total knee replacements without exposing the patient to radiation.
The patellofemoral joint morphology geometries of 33 patients before and after implantation of a bicondylar total knee replacement was intraoperatively analyzed using a digital scanning method.
Femoral surface geometries were extracted from intraoperatively recorded tactile scanning data using an in-house algorithm. The geometries were then characterized by sulcus height, medial femoral condyle height and lateral femoral condyle height.
Our preliminary results show that these key geometric parameters are only partially restored after TKA leading to a distinctly different shaped profile of the anterior distal femur.
Maximum and minimum mean differences in sulcus height, medial femoral condyle height, and lateral femoral condyle height before and after surgery were 2.00 mm/-3.06 mm, 2.51 mm/-6.25 mm and 2.74 mm/-3.58 mm, respectively.
A new method for intraoperative analysis of the patellofemoral joint morphology before and after TKA without radiation exposure was developed and utilized.
Even with the use of modern total knee designs, the patellofemoral articulation is considerably changed postoperatively as quantified by the key parameters of sulcus height, medial femoral condyle height, and lateral femoral condyle height.
This may result in altered knee biomechanics and might explain persistent patellofemoral disorders, which are often reported by patients after TKA.
Irreparable rotator cuff injuries in young patients with moderate to high levels of physical activity remain a challenging pathology for shoulder surgeons.
Irreparable anterior rotator cuff injuries require treatment that seeks to restore the dynamic anterior forces of the glenohumeral joint.
Among surgical treatment options, transfer of the pectoralis major and minor muscle, have shown good functional outcomes.
This technique attempts to reproduce the vector of the subscapular muscle in cases with irreparable tear.
Restoration of the dynamic external and internal couple forces to maintain the humeral head in the center of rotation.
Pectoralis major transfer (PMa): Irreparable subscapularis tendon (SSC) tear in active patients without osteoarthritis.
Pectoralis minor transfer (PMi): Irreparable superior SSC tear with concomitant irreparable supraspinatus tendon (SSP) tear in active patients with no osteoarthritis.
Primary osteoarthritis Samilson grade C, cuff tear arthropathy Hamada III-V, infection, axillary nerve palsy, older patients with low physical demand, combination with irreparable SSP/infraspinatus tendon (ISP) tear for PMa or combination with irreparable ISP tear for PMi.
General anesthesia and beach-chair position with the arm freely mobile in an arm holder.
Deltopectoral approach.
Exposure of the humeral head and confirmation of the irreparability of the subscapularis tendon.
PMa: Detachment of the tendon to be transferred from the humeral insertion, blunt anatomic dissection medially.
Exposure of the conjoined tendon and coracoid process.
PMi: Detachment of the tendon with an osteotomy at the coracoid process.
Passing the PMa or PMi tendon under the conjoined tendon.
The PMa tendon is fixed in a 2-row configuration, the PMi in a single row with suture anchors to the lesser tuberosity.
Shoulder abduction sling (30°) for 6 weeks.
Assisted range-of-motion (ROM) exercises with abduction/adduction 60-0-0°, internal/external rotation free-0-0° for 6 weeks.
Free active ROM exercises after 6 weeks, muscle strengthening after 12 weeks.
The pectoralis major and minor transfer shows an improvement in strength and range of motion in young active patients and an improved Constant score (CS) in long-term follow-up examinations.
Extensive exophytic pigmented viral plaques developed on a Chihuahua dog causing pruritus and discomfort.
Neither the medical treatments used nor a papillomavirus vaccine resulted in clinical improvement.
Laser surgery removed some plaques, yet others developed.
This case illustrates the difficulty in treating viral plaques and the progressive nature of this disease.
In order to prevent implant failure and secondary fracture dislocation, it is often recommended that patients perform partial weight-bearing after surgery of the lower extremity.
Previous examinations showed that patients are often not able to follow these instructions.
In this study, patients who had undergone surgery of the lower extremity were studied in order to analyze whether incorrect loading influenced the number and severity of complications. Fifty-one patients were equipped with electronic shoe insoles, which measure loading and other parameters.
The measurement period was 24 to 102 hours. Median duration of follow-up was 490 days.
The primary outcome parameter was postoperative complications leading to revision surgery.
Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square and Fisher exact tests with significance set at a p < 0.05.
Seven out of fifty-one patients had postoperative complications. Four wound complications, one implant failure, chronic instability after fracture of the tibia, and one implant loosening of a hip prosthesis were recorded.
In total, 26 of 39 patients were not able to follow the postoperative instructions.
Five of the twenty-six patients with difficulties in partial weight-bearing suffered a postoperative complication.
In comparison, only 2 of the other 25 patients were affected. There was no statistically significant correlation between high weight-bearing and occurrence of complications (p = 0.29).
Most of the patients were unable to follow the surgeon's instructions for partial weight-bearing.
Excessive loading did not seem to influence the number and severity of postoperative complications, especially regarding implant failure.
Therefore, we should continue with measurements and reevaluate the 'partial weight-bearing doctrine'.
The leading cause of death among people under 45 years of age is trauma. However, there is little information from the last 10 years on the exact causes of death of seriously injured people after hospital admission in Germany.
The aim of the study is to evaluate the data of a level I trauma centre from the last 10 years.
The reliability of the data, frequency of the causes of death and correlations with the mechanism of injury as well as the confirmability of the data in the TraumaRegister DGU are to be investigated.
The University Hospital Jena data were analysed for 203 deceased trauma patients from accidental death between 2007 and 2017.
A clear determination of the cause of death is possible in about 85% of cases on the basis of hospital data.
The most frequent cause of death of severely injured patients after admission to the hospital is traumatic brain injury (59.6%), followed by organ failure (17%), haemorrhage (14%) and other causes of death (9.4%).
Verification using data from the TraumaRegister DGU is possible.
There is a clear correlation between mechanism of injury and cause of death.
The cause of death is very often a subjective assessment of the recording doctor.
In particular, there are difficulties with patients who die in the resuscitation room before further diagnosis.
The most frequent cause of death today is traumatic brain injury.
For future evaluations, the new information in the TraumaRegister DGU is helpful because the cause of death can only be partially derived from other registry data.
The correlation between the type of accident and the cause of death could be used for preventive measures.
Treatment of severe neutropenia with high-dose pyridoxine in a patient with chronic graft versus host disease and squamous cell carcinoma: a case report
Introduction: The differential diagnosis of neutropenia includes medications, infections, autoimmune diseases, and deficiencies of Vitamin B12 and folate.
The association of Vitamin B6 deficiency with severe neutropenia is a rare finding.
Case presentation: A 51-year-old Caucasian woman presented with fever and profound neutropenia (48 neutrophils/uL).
Her clinical history included non-Hodgkin lymphoma, in remission following treatment with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, quiescent chronic graft-versus-host disease, and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin metastatic to cervical lymph nodes.
Medications included atenolol, topical clobetasol, Ditropan (oxybutynin), prophylactic voriconazole, prophylactic valganciclovir, Soriatane (acitretin), and Carac (fluorouracil) cream.
The bone marrow was hypocellular without metastatic cancer or myelodysplasia.
Neutropenia did not respond to stopping medications that have been associated with neutropenia (valganciclovir, voriconazole and Soriatane) or treatment with antibiotics or granulocyte colony stimulating factor.
Blood tests revealed absence of antineutrophil antibodies, normal folate and B12 levels, moderate zinc deficiency and severe Vitamin B6 deficiency.
Replacement therapy with oral Vitamin B6 restored blood vitamin levels to the normal range and corrected the neutropenia.
Her cervical adenopathy regressed clinically and became negative on scintography following Vitamin B6 therapy and normalization of the blood neutrophil count.
Conclusion: Severe pyridoxine deficiency can lead to neutropenia.
Screening for Vitamin B6 deficiency, along with folate and Vitamin B12 levels, is recommended in patients with refractory neutropenia, especially those with possible malabsorption syndromes, or a history of chronic-graft-versus host disease.
Severe neutropenia may facilitate progression of squamous cell carcinoma.
The patient was a 51-year-old Caucasian woman with relapsed non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated four years earlier with an allogeneic stem cell transplant.
Her lymphoma was in remission.
Complications of her allogeneic transplant included a history of chronic extensive graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) involving the skin and dermal squamous cell carcinoma.
Immunosuppression with cyclosporine had been discontinued two months earlier due to the development of squamous cell carcinoma and the absence of active GvHD.
She had no history of smoking, alcohol, or drug abuse.
She presented with fever and profound neutropenia; serial blood counts showed that the neutropenia had been present for more than a month (Figure 1).
Her examination showed moderate cachexia, long-standing sclerodermatous changes and hyper-pigmentation of the skin consistent with quiescent GvHD, palpable 2.5 cm left cervical and submandibular adenopathy that was flurodeoxy glucose (FDG) avid on positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (PET/CT) scan.
She had a non-focal neurological examination.
A complete blood count showed a normal total leukocyte count (4,600/uL) with 2% granulocytes (48 neutrophils/uL) together with 84% lymphocytes and 14% monocytes.
Red blood cells were 4.24 × 10E12/L, hemoglobin was 12.4 g/dL, hematocrit was 0.37, and the platelet count was 113 × 10E9/L.
Medications included atenolol, topical clobetasol, Ditropan (oxybutynin), prophylactic voriconazole, prophylactic valganciclovir, Soriatane (acitretin), and Carac (fluorouracil) cream.
Blood cultures showed a micrococcus species.
Her iron level was 330 mcg/L with 20% saturation.
Folate, vitamin B1, vitamin B12, copper, vitamin D levels, thyroid function tests, creatinine, bilirubin, liver enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were normal.
Her blood zinc level was borderline low at 49 mcg/dL.
Antineutrophil antibodies were absent (<1:10 titer).
PCR tests for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) in the blood were negative, and had remained negative on prophylactic doses of valganciclovir following CMV reactivation five months earlier.
Her vitamin B6 level was very low at 0.5 ng/mL (reference range 5 to 30 ng/mL).
Serum IgG was polyclonally elevated at 3720 mg/dL as were blood T-cells (4580 cells/uL) and CD8+ T-cells (2836 cells/uL) with normal numbers of CD4+ T-cells, B-cells and natural killer (NK) cells.
Her fever resolved with a course of vancomycin, without identifying a site of infection.
Histological examination of the marrow demonstrated marked hypocellularity without specific megaloblastic or myelodysplastic findings, metastatic cancer, or features to suggest immune-mediated thrombocytopenia.
Cytogenetic analysis showed 100% donor (male) cells without any clonotypic abnormalities.
Biopsy of a cervical lymph node showed poorly differentiated carcinoma, consistent with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.
Valganciclovir, voriconazole, and Soriatane (acitretin) were discontinued (as potential causes of neutropenia) and prophylactic fluconazole and acyclovir were started.
Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF; 300 ug subcutaneously every other day) was administered for four doses in mid February 2010 without any improvement in her neutropenia.
Following daily supplementation with 150 mg Vitamin B6, blood B6 levels normalized concomitant with resolution of the neutropenia (Figure 1).
Following correction of the B6 deficiency and neutropenia, the cervical adenopathy completely regressed by clinical examination and became scintographically negative by PET/CT.
Orthodontic fixed appliances have been proven to be effective in treating a wide variety of malocclusions, and different types of appliances have emerged during recent decades.
However, the comparative effects of different appliances have not been adequately assessed.
Thus, the aim was to assess the occlusal outcome of orthodontic treatment with preadjusted straight-wire (SWIRE) and standard edgewise (SEDGE) appliances.
In all, 56 patients (mean age: 13.5 years; 45% male) receiving extraction-based treatment with either SWIRE or SEDGE appliances were included.
Between-group differences in the occlusal outcome assessed with the American Board of Orthodontists Objective Grading System (ABO-OGS) and treatment duration were analyzed statistically at the 5% level.
The average ABO-OGS score was 31.3 ± 7.2 points and 34.0 ± 10.4 points in the SWIRE and SEDGE groups with no statistically significant difference between groups (P = 0.26).
Treatment duration was significantly shorter in the SWIRE group compared to the SEDGE group, with an average difference of -6.8 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = -9.6 to -4.0 months; P < 0.001).
Likewise, fewer visits were needed with SWIRE compared to SEDGE appliances with an average difference of -7.2 visits (95% CI = -10.3 to -4.2 visits; P < 0.001).
Adjusting for the influence of any potential confounders did not considerably impact the results.
Similar treatment outcomes were observed after premolar extraction treatment with SWIRE and SEDGE appliances.
On the other hand, SEDGE appliances were associated with prolonged treatment duration and more visits needed to complete treatment compared to SWIRE appliances.
Patients from the general practice who had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection between January 2020 and March 2021 participated in an online survey to report their symptoms.
This observational study describes the broad range of mild to moderate symptoms experienced by 160 symptom-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) nonhospitalized patients, including 89 laboratory-confirmed cases.
Compared to confirmed cases, a higher number of presumed and suspected patients had sore throat, shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, fatigue, or severe neck tension.
Unexpected COVID-19-associated clinical features, such as alteration of blood consistency, hormonal imbalance, increased muscle tone and/or aches of skeletal muscles, joint pain, or dermatological disorders were observed by the participants.
In the early period of the pandemic, COVID-19 diagnosis of patients was based on medical symptoms rather than polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serological testing.
These real-world data are essential to understand the pathophysiology of this virus infection and to develop innovative therapeutic approaches.
Multiparametric MRI of the prostate has become a fundamental tool in the diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer and is recommended before (or after negative) biopsy to guide biopsy and increase accuracy, as a staging examination (high-risk setting), and prior to inclusion into active surveillance.
Despite this main field of application, prostate MRI can be utilized to obtain information in a variety of benign disorders of the prostate.
Systematic bibliographical research with extraction of studies, national (German) as well as international guidelines (EAU, AUA), and consensus reports on MRI of benign disorders of the prostate was performed.
Indications and imaging findings of prostate MRI were identified for a) imaging the enlarged prostate, b) prostate MRI in prostatic artery embolization, c) imaging in prostatitis and d) imaging in congenital anomalies.
Different phenotypes of the enlarged prostate that partly correlate with severity of symptoms are discussed.
We provide an overview of the different types of prostatitis and possible imaging findings, highlighting abscesses as a severe complication. The most common congenital anomalies of the prostate are utricular cysts, whereas anomalies like aplasia, hypoplasia, and ectopia are rare disorders.
Knowledge of indications for imaging and imaging appearance of these conditions may improve patient care and enhance differential diagnosis.

To retrospectively evaluate outcomes of a combined interventional approach to stage 1 (cT1cN0cM0) renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) by transarterial embolization (TAE) followed by percutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients ineligible for surgery.
13 patients (9 male, 4 female, 69.6 ± 16.6 y/o) with 14 RCCs (largest diameter: 40.4 ± 6.7 mm, cT1a: 4, cT1b: 10) were treated by RFA a median of one day after TAE in a single center.
Indications for minimally invasive interventional therapy were bilateral RCCs (n = 4), RCCs in a single kidney after nephrectomy (n = 3), increased surgical risk due to comorbidities (n = 4), and rejection of surgical therapy (n = 2).
Technical success, effectiveness, safety, ablative margin, cancer-specific survival, overall survival, and tumor characteristics were analyzed.
All RCCs were successfully ablated after embolization with a minimum ablative margin of 1.2 mm.
The median follow-up was 27 (1-83) months.
There was no residual or recurrent tumor in the ablation zone.
No patient developed metastasis.
Two minor and two major complications occurred.
Four patients with severe comorbidities died during follow-up due to causes unrelated to therapy.
The 1-year and 5-year overall survival was 74.1 % each.
Cancer-specific survival was 100 % after 1 and 5 years.
There was no significant decline in mean eGFR directly after therapy (p = 0.226).
However, the mean eGFR declined from 62.2 ± 22.0 to 50.0 ± 27.8 ml/min during follow-up (p < 0.05).
The combination of TAE and RFA provides an effective minimally invasive therapy to stage 1 RCCs in patients ineligible for surgery.
The outcomes compare favorably with data from surgery.

This study aimed to examine satisfaction with life in patients with urinary incontinence and patients who underwent an operative procedure due to urinary incontinence.
Women with a medical indication for surgery due to urinary incontinence problems but who had not yet had surgery (N = 110) and same-age women who had had a surgical procedure for urinary incontinence (N = 101) completed a set of questionnaires.
The results showed that women with urinary incontinence had significantly higher life satisfaction than women who underwent the operation.
Contrary to expectations, women with urinary incontinence problems reported equal levels of life satisfaction to a comparable sample of postmenopausal normative women.
Higher levels of life satisfaction were related to higher education level, employment, higher perceived socioeconomic level, and urban place of living.
It is important for physicians to address the problem of urinary incontinence with their patients and to examine the present anxiety symptoms, given that they may affect their subjective wellbeing.
The current pandemic caused by COVID-19 has underlined the importance of a joint effort and approach to ensure patient and health care worker safety in medical care throughout Europe.
In addition, the recent flood disasters in Germany and other countries called for immediate joint action, in this case with regard to the prevention of water-borne infections.
Environmental disasters will increase with consequences for hospitals and nursing homes.
Cooperative efforts are needed for preventing and controlling associated infection outbreaks, new pathogens will appear and a geographic shift of infectious diseases previously not detected in certain areas has already been observed.
This approach to infection prevention and control must entail structural as well as regulatory aspects.
The principle of equal protection against infections in all European countries must be implemented.
Prevention and control of infections, including nosocomial infections, infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria as well as pandemics, need to be based on equal standards in all of Europe.
Protection against infections and other public health risks in all European countries is the best guarantor for building trust and identification of citizens in our common Europe.
Experts in the fields of hygiene, microbiology, infectiology and epidemiology have to pool the expertise on the prevention and control of infections from different European countries and define key targets for achieving a high standard of hygiene measures throughout Europe.
The participants of the Rudolf Schülke Foundation International Symposium call for immediate action and priority to be given to the realization of the proposed 16-point plan.
Oxaliplatin-induced thrombotic microangiopathy: a case report
Background: Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy represents a standard of care in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.
We report a rare case of fulminant oxaliplatin-induced thrombotic microangiopathy, clinically suggestive of hemolytic-uremic syndrome, occurring in a female patient with a prolonged history of exposure to oxaliplatin for the treatment of metastatic colon cancer.
Case presentation: A 73-year-old Caucasian female with a treatment history including several lines of chemotherapy for the management of metastatic colon cancer was reinitiated on chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin with bevacizumab for disease progression.
She presented to the emergency department with malaise, headache, vomiting, and decreased urine output appearing a few hours after chemotherapy administration.
Clinical symptoms and laboratory findings were suggestive of thrombotic microangiopathy, with a triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, pronounced thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure.
The predominance of the severe renal failure was evocative of hemolytic-uremic syndrome.
The rapid development of the thrombotic microangiopathy was linked to exposure to oxaliplatin.
The patient was promptly managed with daily plasma exchange and high-dose corticosteroids, platelet, and red blood cell transfusions in conjunction with intermittent hemodialysis, and she recovered progressively.
Conclusion: Our case confirms the risk of hemolytic-uremic syndrome as a rare and life-threatening complication of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.
A dose-dependent, drug-induced toxicity mechanism is suggested.
Physicians need to maintain a high level of clinical suspicion to diagnose and treat this acute life-threatening disorder.
A 73-year-old Caucasian female, never smoker, with a past medical history of hypertension was diagnosed with stage IV colon adenocarcinoma with liver metastasis in October 2008.
She received chemotherapy with capecitabine, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (XELOX) and bevacizumab for five cycles, then underwent a right hemicolectomy and a partial hepatectomy followed by maintenance therapy with bevacizumab.
In February 2011, she was initiated on fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) and cetuximab for disease progression in the liver.
In May 2011, she underwent a resection of the new hepatic lesion followed by intra-arterial chemoembolization sessions for 3 months.
Three years later, in August 2014, a positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET–CT) scan showed evidence of metastatic retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, consistent with disease recurrence.
She was then initiated on mFOLFOX-6 with bevacizumab with a good imaging response, followed by a year of maintenance therapy with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and bevacizumab.
In December 2016, her treatment plan was switched to fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) for disease progression to the lungs, followed by maintenance therapy with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and bevacizumab.
A few months later, in August 2017, a PET–CT scan showed a new lung nodule.
She was then shifted to mFOLFOX6 with panitumumab followed by maintenance therapy with fluorouracil and leucovorin.
In May 2018, the treatment protocol was changed to FOLFIRI with cetuximab, until a new disease progression in the lymph nodes, and then around the hepatic artery stent, occurred in January 2019.
The patient was then reinitiated on mFOLFOX6 with bevacizumab.
She received her first cycle on 21 February and later experienced an episode of neutropenia for which the second cycle was delayed.
On 11 March, she received her second cycle of chemotherapy with a 25% dose reduction.
On 13 March, she presented to the emergency department with fatigue, malaise, orbital headache, nausea and vomiting, mild abdominal pain, and chills.
She stated that her symptoms started hours after the chemotherapy infusion and reported a decrease in urine output and a darkening of urine.
On physical examination, the patient had jaundice with icteric sclera since a day ago.
Her vitals showed a temperature of 37.1 °C, a heart rate of 88 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, a blood pressure of 16.7/7.2 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
A cardiac workup ruled out acute myocardial infarction.
The initial blood workup was significant for thrombocytopenia (platelet count 30.103 cells/mm3) and anemia (hemoglobin 8.1 mg/dL).
The anemia was defined as hemolytic by markedly increased bilirubin (total bilirubin 6.4 mg/dL, indirect bilirubin 3.3 mg/dL), high aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (1725 IU/L), high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (4866 IU/L), and low haptoglobin (< 0.1 g/L).
The patient also showed signs of acute renal failure (serum creatinine had markedly increased from 0.9 to 5.5 mg/dL within a week, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 78 mg/dL, and uric acid 10.6 mg/dL).
The blood film inspection showed signs of hemolysis with a slight anisopoikilocytosis, slight hypochromia, some ovalocytes and echinocytes, few schistocytes and helmet cells, rare teardrop red blood cells, and rare stomatocytes.
There were also occasional polychromatophilic red blood cells (reticulocytosis).
Antibody screening was negative, confirming the MAHA diagnosis.
The coagulation panel was normal.
Relevant laboratory parameters are documented in Table 1.
Her chronic medications included irbesartan/amlodipine and atenolol.
The clinical laboratory findings were consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).
An ADAMTS13 activity test was performed to investigate a potential TTP, whereas the significant picture of the predominance of renal failure was more suggestive of HUS.
The occurrence of TMA after the chemotherapy session was suggestive of drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy (DITMA), notably related to the administration of a chemotherapy agent.
Treatment was started promptly with daily plasma exchange and immunosuppression with methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) until a diagnosis of TTP was ruled out, then tapered later on.
She also received packed red blood cell transfusions and platelet transfusions, and underwent daily intermittent hemodialysis.
Electrolyte imbalances were also managed.
Seven days later, the patient’s laboratory studies (Table 1) showed a stable hemoglobin level, a much-improved platelet count, and no clinical evidence of hemolysis.
Her platelet count normalized on day 12.
Daily plasma exchange was continued for eight consecutive days, and dialysis for eight consecutive days.
The patient was transferred to another medical center in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for continuity of care and possible treatment of the DITMA with eculizumab.
The aim of the present bibliometric study was to record the focus of publications, type of study and publication activities depending on the hierarchy level and gender of the authors of German university departments for orthopaedic surgery.
The publication performance of the staff surgeons, consisting of chief and senior physicians, section and division heads of 39 German university departments of orthopaedic surgery university hospitals, was recorded over a period of 10 years (January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019).
All publications were considered that were listed in PubMed and for which the staff surgeons were first or last authors.
In addition, the impact factor (IF) and the h-index were determined.
1739 (39.2%) publications were compiled by 180 staff surgeons of university departments for trauma surgery and 2699 (60.8%) publications by 343 surgeons in departments of orthopaedics and trauma surgery.
Most publications were related to injuries or impairments of the lower extremity including the hip (n = 1626; 38.1%), followed by the upper extremity (n = 737; 17.3%).
These publications focussed on diagnostic testing (25.5%), surgical techniques (19.1%) or special osteosyntheses (16.9%).
The highest average IF per publication was achieved by publications on plastics (IF 2.02), on outcome (IF 1.96) and on diagnostic testing (IF 1.93).
Heads of departments were first authors in 18.8%, senior physicians with management functions in 40.7% and senior physicians without management functions in 69% of papers and last authors in 81.2%, 49.3% and 31.0% of articles, respectively.
64 of 523 staff surgeons (12.2%) were women.
306 authors (6.1%) were women, corresponding to 4.8 authorships per female surgeon - significantly for male surgeons (10.3 authorships per male surgeon).
In the present study, among senior physicians with a management function, the share of publishing surgeons was 59.1% for women, but 85.5% for men. In contrast, in the group of senior physicians without management function female and male surgeons were almost equally represented (57.5% vs. 60.5%).
It must therefore be asked whether the work life balance is more difficult to meet for women than for men with longer careers.
Mentoring programs are required to support the publication activities of the increasing number of female applicants in the future.
Cutaneous horn is a skin disease with low incidence and few citations in the literature.
This report describes a dog with multiple cutaneous lesions of papillomatosis and one giant cutaneous horn on the face.
Two sessions of cryotherapy achieved complete remission of the lesions.
Rotational atherectomy (RA) has improved percutaneous treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions, but the 'no-reflow' phenomenon remains a serious complication.
Platelet activation by RA may contribute to no-reflow, and the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to test the effect of RA on white thrombus could confirm platelet activation indirectly.
We analyzed 53 consecutive patients with severely calcified lesions on coronary angiography.
All patients were examined with OCT.
In total, 20 patients who received RA and for whom OCT imaging was performed before and after RA and stent implantation comprised the RA group.
The remaining 33 patients formed the control group, for whom OCT imaging was performed before balloon dilatation and after stent implantation.
The patients in the RA group were older and had a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus.
In the control group, there was no thrombogenesis during the procedure, whereas in the RA group, all the target vessels had white thrombi on OCT after RA.
The average number of white thrombi per lesion after RA was 7.23 ± 4.4, and the average length of white thrombus was 0.51 ± 0.33 mm.
Statistical analysis with Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that thrombus load was related to burr size (r = 0.575, p = 0.040) and number of rotations (r = 0.599, p = 0.031).
White thrombi during RA can be verified by performing OCT.
Treating calcified lesions with RA may enhance thrombogenesis.
These data suggest using appropriate therapy to avoid no-reflow during RA.
Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disease characterized by fragile bones and variable short stature.
We performed a retrospective cohort study to evaluate demographic data, clinical findings, growth and pubertal characteristics, and medical treatment of 83 OI patients. 83 (31 female/52 male) patients were enrolled in the study.
The median follow-up duration was 4.7 (0.6-17.7) years.
51 out of 83 patients (61.4%) received bisphosphonate therapy.
The median Z-score of the bone mineral density improved in patients with OI-I and OI-III with the treatment.
During follow-up, height-SDS significantly increased in both OI-I and OI-III on treatment; however, final adult height SDS of patients did not improve.
The frequency of overweight and obesity was found to be increased at the last evaluation compared to the admission.
The rate of precocious puberty (PP) and early puberty (EP) were 20 and 10% in girls, and they were 15.7 and 47.3% in boys, respectively.
Reduced growth, significant weight gain over time due to impaired mobility, and high frequency of PP/EP require effective interventions to improve mobility and functional parameters as early as possible in children with OI.
We compared serum levels of S100A12, a proinflammatory protein predominantly secreted by neutrophils, in children with newly diagnosed childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE), systemic juvenile arthritis (sJIA), and systemic undefined recurrent fevers (SURFS) to examine its role as a diagnostic and discriminative marker of inflammation and to indirectly point out the importance of neutrophils and innate immunity in the pathogenesis of these diseases.
In a cross-sectional study, the serum levels of S100A12 protein of 68 children (19 with cSLE, 18 with sJIA, 7 with SURFS, and 24 controls) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared between groups and with clinical and laboratory findings.
The median serum S100A12 levels were 469 ng/mL in the cSLE group, 6103 ng/mL in the sJIA group, 480 ng/mL in the SURFS group, and 44 ng/mL in the control group.
Children with cSLE, sJIA, and SURFS had significantly higher serum S100A12 levels compared to the control group (p < 0.0001).
sJIA patients had the highest levels of S100A12 in comparison to other patients (p < 0.0001), while there was no significant difference between children with cSLE and SURFS.
Elevated serum SA100A12 levels in children with cSLE, sJIA, and SURFS may indicate intense neutrophil activation, which may play an important role in innate immunity in chronic inflammation in these diseases.
Serum S100A12 levels could be used as a diagnostic marker of inflammation and be suitable for distinguishing sJIA and other disorders.
This study aimed to design and implement a mobile phone application (app) aiming to enhance the cooperation and oral hygiene of orthodontic patients.
An orthodontic app named 'Labkhand' was designed by a team of orthodontists and programmers according to the needs and scheduled interventions for patients.
The aim of this app was to obviate the orthodontic needs of patients by providing educational content in the form of texts and videos, oral hygiene reminders, appointment reminders, and nutrition reminders.
It also enabled instant messaging and chatting between patients and dental personnel.
In this study, 61 patients were monitored during their orthodontic treatment procedure.
All patients were evaluated using a questionnaire with 7 questions before and after a 6-month treatment period.
A total of 31 patients were instructed to use the app, while the other 30 patients received treatment without the app.
The collected data were analyzed using paired t‑test and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) test.
While the control group's questionnaire score remained almost the same (P > 0.05), the mean questionnaire score of patients in the intervention group significantly increased after using the app compared to the baseline scores acquired before using the app (P < 0.001).
The greatest improvement was noted in topics related to 'reminding of appointments', 'general information about orthodontic treatment', and 'oral hygiene maintenance and instructions'. 'Quality of services' and 'patient-orthodontist communication' showed the least improvement in patient satisfaction.
The Labkhand orthodontic app has multiple functions and can obviate the needs of orthodontic patients easily and at a low cost.
We investigated the feasibility of evaluating coronary arteries with a contrast-enhanced (CE) self-navigated sparse isotropic 3D whole heart T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study sequence.
A total of 22 consecutive patients underwent coronary angiography and/or cardiac computed tomography (CT) including cardiac MRI.
The image quality was evaluated on a 3-point Likert scale.
Inter-reader variability for image quality was analyzed with Cohen's kappa for the main coronary segments (left circumflex [LCX], left anterior descending [LAD], right coronary artery [RCA]) and the left main trunk (LMT).
Inter-reader agreement for image quality of the coronary tree ranged from substantial to perfect, with a Cohen's kappa of 0.722 (RCA<sub>mid</sub>) to 1 (LCX<sub>prox</sub>).
The LMT had the best image quality.
Image quality of the proximal vessel segments differed significantly from the mid- and distal segments (RCA<sub>prox</sub> vs. RCA<sub>dist</sub>, p < 0.05).
The LCX segments showed no significant difference in image quality along the vessel length (LCX<sub>prox</sub> vs. LCX<sub>dist</sub>, p = n.s.).
The mean acquisition time for the study sequence was 553 s (±46 s).
Coronary imaging with a sparse 3D whole-heart sequence is feasible in a reasonable amount of time producing good-quality imaging.
Image quality was poorer in distal coronary segments and along the entire course of the LCX.
As vaccination campaigns are in progress in most countries, hopes to win back more normality are rising.
However, the exact path from a pandemic to an endemic virus remains uncertain.
While in the pre-vaccination phase many critical indoor situations were avoided by strict control measures, for the transition phase a certain mitigation of the effect of indoor situations seems advisable.
To better understand the mechanisms of indoor airborne transmissions, we present a new time-discrete model to calculate the level of exposure towards infectious SARS-CoV-2 aerosol and carry out a sensitivity analysis for the level of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol exposure in indoor settings.
Time limitations and the use of any kind of masks were found to be strong mitigation measures, while how far the effort for a strict use of professional face pieces instead of simple masks can be justified by the additional reduction of the exposure dose remains unclear.
Very good ventilation of indoor spaces is mandatory.
The definition of sufficient ventilation in regard to airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission follows other rules than the standards in ventilation design.
This means that especially smaller rooms most likely require a significantly greater fresh air supply than usual.
Further research on 50% group models in schools is suggested.
The benefits of a model in which the students come to school every day, but for a limited time, should be investigated.
In terms of window ventilation, it has been found that many short opening periods are not only thermally beneficial, they also reduce the exposure dose.
The fresh air supply is driven by the temperature gradient and wind speed.
However, the sensitivity towards these parameters is not very high and in times of low wind and temperature gradients, there are no arguments against keep windows open in order to make up for the reduced air flow rate.
Long total opening periods and large window surfaces will strongly reduce the exposure.
Additionally, the results underline the expectable fact that exposure doses will increase when hygiene and control measures are reduced.
It seems advisable to investigate what this means for the infection rate and the fatality of infections in populations with partial immunity.
Very basic considerations suggest that the value of aerosol reduction measures may be reduced with very infectious variants such as delta.
Platelets play critical roles in hemostasis and thrombosis.
While low platelet counts increase the risk of bleeding, antithrombotic drugs, including anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, are used to treat thromboembolic events.
Thus, the management of thrombosis in patients with low platelet counts is challenging with hardly any evidence available to guide treatment.
Recognition of the underlying cause of thrombocytopenia is essential for assessing the bleeding risk and tailoring therapeutic options.
A typical clinical scenario is the occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients experiencing transient thrombocytopenia during myelosuppressive chemotherapy.
In such patients, the severity of thrombocytopenia, thrombus burden, clinical symptoms, and the timing of VTE relative to thrombocytopenia must be considered. In clinical practice, distinct hematological disorders characterized by low platelet counts and a thrombogenic state require specific diagnostics and treatment. These include the antiphospholipid syndrome, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and (spontaneous) HIT syndromes, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
Since nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the leading cause of liver disease in the Western world, clinicians need reliable noninvasive tools for the identification of NAFLD-associated fibrosis.
Limited evidence on the performance of the novel shear wave elastography technique Elast-PQ (EPQ) in NAFLD is available.
In this prospective, European multinational study we assessed the diagnostic accuracy of EPQ using vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) as a reference standard.
Among 353 NAFLD patients, 332 (94.1%) fulfilled reliability criteria of VCTE and EPQ (defined by IQR/median ≤0.3; 41.3% female, mean age: 59 [IQR: 16.5], mean BMI: 29.0 (7.1)).
4/353 (1.1%) and 17/353 (4.8%) had unreliable VCTE and EPQ measurements, respectively. VCTE-based NAFLD fibrosis stages were F0/F1: 222(66.9%), F2: 41 (12.3%), F3: 30 (9.1%), F4: 39 (11.7%). We found a strong correlation (Pearson R=0.87; p<0.0001) and concordance (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient =0.792) of EPQ with VCTE.
EPQ was able to identify NAFLD-fibrosis risk with the following EPQ cutoffs: ≥6.5 kPa for significant fibrosis (≥F2) (≥1.47 m/s; sensitivity: 78%; specificity: 95%; AUROC: 0.94), ≥6.9 kPa for advanced fibrosis (≥F3) (≥1.52 m/s; sens.: 88%, spec.: 89%; AUROC: 0.949), and ≥10.4 kPa for cirrhosis (F4) (≥1.86 m/s; sens.: 87%; spec.: 94%; AUROC: 0.949).
The point shear wave elastography technique EPQ shows excellent correlation to and concordance with VCTE.
EPQ can reliably exclude NAFLD fibrosis <6.0 kPa (<1.41 m/s) and indicate a high risk of advanced fibrosis ≥10.4 kPa (≥1.86 m/s).
In late 2020, as soon as the approval of the first vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became foreseeable in line with the normative political goal of providing comparable living conditions to all residents of Germany irrespective of where they live, the German national government's national vaccination strategy called for the widespread establishment of COVID-19 vaccination centers.
As the vaccination program has been rolled out, difficulties in accessing vaccination centers have been reported. Against this background, the paper considers the questions whether, where and for whom spatial inequalities in COVID-19 vaccination center accessibility in Germany might exist.
Such an understanding might help to prepare for future situations when adequate disaster response requires, similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government to quickly reach great parts of the population in an efficient manner.
To approach this question, we examine the accessibility by the means of transport foot, bicycle, car and public transport at small scale based on an accessibility model from the point of view of the 'households'.
We found that in contrast to the common belief COVID-19 vaccination center accessibility or inaccessibility in Germany does not seem to be a spatial phenomenon cheating non-rural regions and discriminating rural regions as anticipated, it is instead strongly dependent on people's individual mobility capabilities in both rural and urban areas.
