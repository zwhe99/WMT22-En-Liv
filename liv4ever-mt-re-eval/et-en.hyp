The Moon – Livonian Summer University and Lāži dams
The Liv Summer University, which took place in 2013, is a common photo of participants on the Liv Beach at the famous Lāž dams.
From July 30 to August 8, 2021, the third Liv Summer University was held in Koshrags, organized by the UL Liv Institute in cooperation with the University of Tartu.
Participants at Liv Summer University met with Liv language speakers, studied Liv language, Liv history and culture, as well as the situation of today; one topic was the last historical location of the Livs – the Beach of Livs, which is why it became the place to take place at Liv Summer University.
Already from the first Liv Summer University, which took place in 2013, the tradition is a joint photo of participants on the Liv Beach at the famous Lāži dams.
The lake dams have been proud and proud of the village of Vaide for at least two hundred years.
Nika Polmanis (1823), the first teacher of the Liv language with special education, was born at the Lash farm; since the 60s of the 19th century, the family of Launičs, whose representative Andrejs Launičs wrote about the Livonian wedding and life commutes in the 19th century. The Liv primary school has also operated in the Lash House (1923-1937).
In the late 1930s, Alfons Bertholds (Alfons Bertholds, 1910–1993) became the owner of the Laži farm – a fisherman, a Liv poet and a Liv folklore – and also now lives in the family of Laži dams.
The University of Livonia is over, but a few moments of it can be seen on Latvian TV.
Once again – thanks to all participants and supporters – to the University of Tartu ASTRA project PER ASPERA, the Ministry of Education and research of Latvia, the University of Latvia and other friends.
Special thanks to Talsi TV for its heartfelt meeting and Marc Daniel Skibsted Volhardt, Tuuli Tuisule and Miina Norvik for their memories.
Tomorrow the third Liv Summer University will start in Koštrõg.

Good to use the updated portal!
The Livs are an indigenous nation of Latvia among the Finnish peoples of the western sea, which has had a major influence on the development of modern Latvian language and culture.
The Latvian language originated as a result of contact between the Livs and several ancient white nations – Latinos, Semigalians and Kurzeme – and its unique characteristics developed just because of this peer-to-peer influence.
The influence of the Liv language is also well felt in the traditional and contemporary culture of Latvia from folklore to cooking commemoration.
For this reason, traditional Liv culture belongs to the Latvian cultural canon and the role of Liv traditions in the development of Latvia’s identity is also underlined in the preamble of the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia.
The Livs have been able to preserve their language and culture until now and have continued to develop it as part of the modern Latvian cultural space.
The Liv language is the language of the Western Sea Finnish group of the Ural language, unlike the Latvian language, which is the white language group of the Indo-European language group.
The closest relative languages of the Liv language are Estonian, Finnish and herd language and the more remote relatives of Saami, Hungarian, mordva and other Ural languages.
The Liv language is included in UNESCO’s selection of world endangered languages as highly endangered language.
The status of the Liv language in Latvia is provided for in § 4 of the State Language Act: “The State shall ensure the preservation, preservation and development of the Liv language as an indigenous language (autouthical language).
Since 2009, the Liv language as part of traditional Liv culture has been included in the Latvian cultural canon.
At the end of the 19th century, there were still about 3,000 Liv speakers; by the middle of the 20th century, their number had fallen to about 1,500 speakers, and by now only 30 people are able to communicate with Liv.
The number of people who have learned the basics of the Liv language is growing all the time.
Knowledge of the Liv language and the skills of the Liv language are important to understand the nature of the Latvian language, since both languages have influenced each other while living together.
While there are few Liv language speakers, this language is important for Ural language explorers because it is unique and has many ancient features.
The Livonian language skills are also important for the Livonian people themselves, because it is the Liv language that has always been the basis for their identity.
Currently, the Liv language can be studied on its own, in courses and camps, as well as in some universities.
I hope you can learn the Liv language online in the future.
The Livs are not only unique in terms of their language and history, but also because of their abundant spiritual heritage. For more information about it can be found in the section of traditional culture.
The Livonian people have continued to develop their culture today – art, music and literature, the roots of which date back to almost 200 years.
For more information about modern Liv culture, see the section of modern culture.
All publicly available information about the Livonian people have been gathered into the library.
Here you can find various studies dedicated to Liv history and culture (Liv language studies can be found at lingua.livones.net), books, web resources, videos, etc.
The heading is supplemented with publications and news that are currently published.

Viktors Bertholds – Livonian, fisherman, treater – 100
Viktors Bertholdsi (1921–2009) was the last to speak the Liv language every day, at least until his wife Marta (born Liedane, 1925–1994) was still alive. V. Bertholds was also one of those visited by Estonian and Finnish scientists and the last person to speak freely on the Liv coast.
On January 16, 2021, we celebrate Viktors Bertholds’ 100th anniversary.
Most of his life was spent by Viktor Bertholds Kolkas.
He began working on Liv's things at a later time when Liv's speakers had very little left behind and the value of each liv's knowledge had increased hard.
In the early 1990s Viktors and Marta taught the Liv language to colleagues of the man.
While Viktor was still in power, he was always on the first Saturday of August at the Liv Festival in Mazirbe.
Viktors Bertholds was born on 16 January 1921 in Kārlis un Marija Bertholds’ family in Vaides, Genak.
Genak was home to at least six generations of large and strong Livonian Bertholdiste family, and many important Liv cultural characters have picked up this family.
Viktors and his brother Alfons Bertholds (a Liv poet and folklore narrator), who grew up in a rigorous Liv family, kept the Liv language alive throughout their lifetime.
Today's best Liv language speakers are the successors of the Bertholdsite family.
Kārlis un Marija Bertholds with her oldest son Alfons in Vaides, Genak, about 1920.
While the paper had the last family in Livonian on a daily basis in Viktors and Marta Bertholds, neither of their children learned Livonian.
Daughter Āria Bertholde, who moved to the United States in 1995 with daughter Baiba, recalled:
We talked about Liv language every day at home.
Even if the parents didn’t want the children to understand their story.
I wanted to learn the Liv language.
I know only a few words now, and some songs are still in mind.
I thought I could read because I remember how my mother taught me to read the letters.
When I asked her mother why she was not taught the language, she replied that it was an unrecognised language that cannot be taught.

Viktors Bertholds left 88 years old on 23 February 2009.
He rests in Kolka cemetery.

THREE DIVISIONS IN THE LIGHT
On November 5, a joint meeting of the boards of the Liv Foundation and the Liv Culture Centre (Liv Culture Centre) was held, talking about the possibilities offered by the website livones.lv to use and promote the Liv language.
Both organizations found that the reorganisation and expansion of the website not only enables the exchange of ideas and news in Livonian, but also to communicate greetings and messages in Livones.lv chat room.
Therefore, at the initiative of the LKS, it was decided that from 25 November every Wednesday night at 20.30 an hour in the Liv language will be discussed.
Valts Ernštreits was elected a moderator.
Is it possible to get rid of it in your life?

2011 - YEAR OF THE LIV CULTURE AND CULTUU
The International Society of Liv Friends and the Centre for Liv Culture (Liv Culture Centre) has adopted a decision to declare the year 2011 an international year of Liv language and culture.
The reasons for this are both cultural historical, in relation to important dates and topical, since 2011 appears to be a number of unique events.
In 2011, 150 years after the first Liv language grammar and dictionary was published at the Russian Academy of Sciences in St Petersburg (A. J. Sjögren’s and F. J. Wiedeman’s joint work), the work also included the first examples of Liv folklore, poetry and spiritual texts.
90 years is completed from the release of the first secular Liv language book – the first Liv reading book (First Liv reading). With this, the Academic Emakeele Selts started its series of editors.
80 years ago, with the support of the Finnish Academic Tribal Club (Akateeminen Heimoklubi), the first periodical Liv language publication – newspaper Līvli (Livonian) began to appear.
75 years ago, Liv Kōrli Stalte prepared the first Liv language assistant on the order of the Academic Mother Language Society, whose manuscript was found five years ago in the Estonian State Archives.
20 years ago, the cultural historic territory of the State of Latvia was founded by the Livonian coast (Livonian Beach). The Law of the Republic of Latvia recognized the Livonian “free development of Latvian national and ethnic groups and the right to cultural autonomy” as an indigenous nation of Latvia.
It is also five years since the start of the Livones.lv Livonian Culture and Language portal. It is the only mass information tool to share information in Livonian, Latvian, English and also in Finnish.
Liv language and culture is not only a historic value covered by dust of centuries and centuries.
It is still a source of important research and discoveries enriching modern cultural life and offering discoveries that have not only scientific, but also practical importance.
In 2011, Estonia’s largest Liv-Estonian dictionary was published.
It was created by prof. em. Tiit-Rein Viitso, the most prominent Liv language researcher today, using various Liv text collections based on various Liv text samples, including material collected by Livonian Peteris Dambergs.
The new dictionary, which also includes Liv grammar, will be an appropriate Liv language learning tool with authentic samples.
On 10 December this year, Valts Ernštreits defended the Doctoral degree in philology at the University of Tartu with the research “The Development of the Liv Liv Liv Liv Language”. In 2011, based on his doctoral work, the book will be published from Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv language sources.
International scientific conferences, seminars, exhibitions and other events are held in Latvia and Estonia.
The main cooperation partners of the International Liv Friends Society and the Liv Culture Centre in Estonia are the Fenno-Ugria Foundation, the University of Tartu, the Estonian Language Institute and the Emakeele Society, Latvia – Latvian Academy of Sciences, Latvian Language Agency, Latvian National History Museum, etc.
The coordinator of events in Latvia is Valts Ernštreits, Tapio Mäkeläinen in Finland and Tuuli Tuisk in Estonia.
Professor Mati Hindi congratulations to the International Conference of the Year of Liv Language and Culture 25.11.2011.
My thoughts are on the Beach today and those who consider the Liv language expensive.
Let them be fine all this life.
Things are complicated and be it, but we do not want to forget about Livonian.
All good wishes to you all – Mati Hint.

Subsequently
The Liv language is an ancient Latvian indigenous language among Finnish-Ugri languages.
In the 12th century, it was discussed in the territory of modern Latvia around the Gulf of Livonia, the northern part of the Kuramaa Peninsula, the lower run of the Koiva and Väina, as well as around Riga, the current capital of Latvia.
By step, the Livs melted into neighbouring nations, becoming part of the modern Latvian people and leaving deep traces of the Latvian language.
In the mid-19th century, the Liv language was spoken in two regions of Latvia.
One of them was about St. River, or St.upe, on the east coast of the Bay of Liivimaa, where at least 22 people spoke the Livonian language.
The Liv language has disappeared in a short time.
The second place was the Liv Beach, covering 14 fishermen on the North Kuramaa coast from Ovish to Ģipkan, and in which about 2,500 people spoke the Liv language.
In the 20th century, the number of Liv language learners also decreased in Kuramaa.
This was promoted by both World Wars and the Soviet occupation, but the Livs, their supporters from other Finnish-Ugrin nations, as well as Latvia participated actively in the preservation and development of the Liv language and culture.
In the 1950s, the border zone was established throughout the Liv coast, as it was now the western border of the Soviet Union.
Fishing, which had long been the main activity of the Livonian people, and access to the sea, was restricted.
Many of the Livonian people travelled to major cities, most of them to Riiga and Ventspils.
The winters were empty, and the last area where Liv language was spoken in all villages ceased to exist.
Instead of the left Livonian, Latvians soon arrived, and now the Livonian coast sounds primarily Latvian.
Most of the Livonians currently live in Riga, Ventspils, Kolkas and other parts of Latvia.
According to the 2011 census, 250 people in Latvia consider themselves Livonian.
Today, the Liv language is listed as UNESCO’s world’s endangered language list.
There are only a little more than 20 people in the world who can talk in Livonian.
These include three authors of this book.
For this reason, although Liv literature is certainly the smallest in Europe in terms of the number of readers, it is the highest in terms of the number of Livs and Livs.
The influence and meaning of Liv language and culture extends much beyond what it might seem like based on the current number of Livs and Livs.
The Livonian has played an important role in the history of the Baltic region and in the development of Latvian language and culture.
Among the contemporary famous Latvian writers, composers, artists, statemen and other intellectuals, there are many who are borne from the Livonian people.
After the loss of language and land, the Livs have been thrown away as keepers of their feelings and heritage – it has helped the Liv language and culture continue to exist today.
It is important that, for almost 200 years, the Livonians have also developed their modern culture alongside keeping heritage culture.
It has evolved consistently with the culture of neighbouring Livonian people, Latvians and Estonians.
This means that the Livs have not only preserved their linguistic skills and practices so far, but also developed their linguistic language and new cultural traditions manifested in the works of contemporary Liv poets, artists, composers and other creatives.
Primary Liv Liv Liv Liv
The first words in the Liv language are found in the Henry Livonian Chronicle, which was written in the 13th century, which is an important document to examine the history of the Livonian and the Baltic region as a whole.
The first texts in the Liv language were probably printed in the 16th century.
However, the vast majority of the Liv language texts published before the mid-19th century have been written primarily as samples of languages that were not intended for the Livs themselves, including the first Liv language books printed in London in 1863 – the Matthew evangelium in the western and east fractures of the Kuramaa Liv language.
The first book specifically designed for the Livs was also the translation of Matthew's gospel, prepared on the basis of the above translations and published in 1880 in St Petersburg.
However, the first examples of Liv language literature were born in the mid-19th century, when St. Petersburg academics Anders Johan Sjögren and Ferdinand Johann Wiedemann arrived.
The first Liv grammar compiled by them, along with the Liv language samples and the Liv-German dictionary, was published in St. Petersburg in 1861.
Among the descriptions of other language samples, such as proverbs, folk songs, musicians and practices, poems written by John Prince and his son Peter Prince were also published, which became the first examples of the Liv literature.
The Prince of Jāņ was a Liv fisherman and writer from the village of Pizā, where he also held a rope office for several years.
Later, he resided in Ventspils, where he set the foundation for the Ventspils district of Ostgals, one of the streets of Ventspils – Prinču iela or Princes Street – is named in honor of the Princes family.
The Prince of John lived in Ventspils until the end of life.
He was a talented linguist and writer.
This is referred to both by the Liv language news words he proposed to both of the aforementioned researchers in St Petersburg and by his articles in the Latvian press at the time.
Before the arrival of Sjögren and Wiedeman, John Prince had written several articles in Latvian and Livonian.
He also made some translations.
Jāņ Prints was of the opinion that for future generations he must hand over beautiful, clean and rich Liv language and show that the Liv language is the same cultural language as any other major European language.
This is probably why John Prince wrote his first Liv language poems and also made the first translations.
The parent of John Prince is also important for Latvian literature.
His book of poetry written in Latvian in the Sacred Songs and Prayers of the Seamen, which he wrote along with his eldest son John, was published in Miitav or Jālga in 1845.
It was the second collection of original songs in the history of Latvian literature.
Reading the poems written by John Prince more than 170 years ago, you can only be impressed with how modern his language shapes are, when images and rituals of his poetry are thoughtful.
His texts mean that history might have been different.
If John Prince had been able to learn more about cultural life not only in the fishermen’s villages, but also elsewhere, he might have become a remarkable and bright 19th century cultural identity beyond Latvia and the Baltic States in the context of Europe as well.
Livonian literature in the 20th century
The Liv Liv literature began to develop quickly after World War I, when the idea of 19th century national romantism in Europe had begun again, and several new nations were born after the collapse of the vast empires.
When Russia's empire grew out of ruins as independent countries Latvia, Estonia and Finland, the Livs again became a key part of the history of this region.
Special attention was paid to the Livs by Estonian and Finnish scientists and cultural characters.
They were inspired by the idea of Finnish-Ugric tribal nations primarily in Europe talking Indo-European languages.
The actions of these investigators and creatives were also affected by the fact that research and cooperation with other Finnish-Ugrin peoples, other than the Sams and Hungarians, had been difficult at the time since they had left the newly established Soviet Union.
This way several Finnish and Estonian researchers unexpectedly encountered great interest in the Livonian people, began researching and assisting the Livonian people, as well as supported the Finnish and Estonian efforts to preserve the Livonian language and culture.
The first and most notable of those investigators who arrived on the Liivi randa were Finn Lauri Kettunen (1885–1963), Professor of Western Sea Finnish languages at the University of Tartu and author of the Liv-German dictionary published in 1938, and Estonian Oskar Loorits (1900–1961), student of Lauri Kettunen and the late Liv folklore collector and researcher.
During the first expedition in the Liv villages in 1920, both scientists, in addition to the collection of Liv language and culture, began talking about the fact that Livians should pay more attention to their heritage, which must be kept and developed.
This is why they helped to create and revitalise the Liv cultural life, to establish the song choir and the first Liv social organization, to assist in teaching Liv language in schools, etc.
One of their most important works was the creation of possibilities for publishing Liv language texts.
In 1921 Lauri Kettunen and Oskar Loorits issued the first Liv reading and continued to issue such readings until 1926.
Along with the articles written by folklore texts and authors, the poems and stories created by the Livs themselves were also published in the reading.
These books and the monthly letter Līvli (1931–1939) later became the development media of Liv Liv literature, where both previous and new Liv authors were able to publish their works during the interwar period.
It should be noted that the most popular genre of literature has been poetry in Liv literature.
This is understandable because poetry has always been in the important place of neighbouring Livonian people.
Poems are easy to reveal, and it takes mostly less time to write a prose.
It was also important for several Liv authors, who were mostly fishermen and engaged in more creatures and nets than closed and paper.
The best-known Liv writer of this period was Kōrli Stalte (1870–1947) – poet, translator, keeper and developer of Liv culture.
Stalte was also the first leader of the League, founded in 1923.
He was also editor of the Livonian Monthly (1933–1939) and a translator who translated the New Testament into the Liv language.
Most of all, Stalte has gathered renown for its secular and spiritual Liv language poems.
Stalte began writing before World War I.
In the 1920s and 1930s, he was the most faithful Liv poet and the first author of Livonian poetry Livo songs (Livonian songs) published in Tallinn.
In his work, Stalte paid the most attention to the Livonian day, he addressed important patriotic and spiritual issues for the Livonian people.
However, his poems are versatile, including simple folklores and fine-cooked sonettes.
Stalte is particularly remarkable in the fact that many of his poems were born as song texts for the Liv song choirs (he is also the author of the Liv anthem).
The same can be said of another Liv poet.
The singers are often convinced to sing folk songs, although the texts of these songs have actually been written by some familiar Liv poets.
In the late 1930s, Stalte compiled a manuscript of the Liv Reader, which was published as a book only in 2011, when it was the International Year of Liv Language and Culture.
Kōrli Stalte's poems in this book can be considered as outstanding examples of Liv literature.
The same can be said of other texts from the readiness written by Stalte, which were originally designed for children, but show the world so lively and truthfully using good and beautiful Liv language that reading them offers true joy to every Liv language learner.
The stories reflect their daily lives in Livonian villages and elsewhere.
However, the first Liv proosapals appeared a little earlier, in the third Liv reading (1923).
It was compiled by August Skadiņ and the issue of the reader was supported by the Estonian Karskusliit.
In the book, Skadiņ published several tales about toughness, which he had written himself.
In 1935, a Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonia
In addition to the translations, the reading also contains poems and stories written by the Liv writers, some of which Damberg has written himself.
Pētõr Damberg was a very important person in Liv literature and newer culture.
He was active in several areas, wrote and translated into Liv language poetry, gathered and translated into Liv folklore, developed Liv language, advised Liv culture and language researchers, participated in drawing up several dictionaries, including Liv-Latvian-esperanto dictionary.
He kept the Liv cultural life during the Soviet occupation.
In the 1930s, Peter Damberg participated in the issue of the Monthly Livonian text in the seminar of teachers in Jelgava.
Peter Damberg wrote the poem most.
His poetry is characterized by a wide range of language uses and multilayer structures.
He has also written several of his memorial stories, which may be considered among the best examples of the Liv prose.
In 1967 Damberg compiled a manuscript of a new Liv reader.
This includes examples of socialist realism in Soviet times, which are not found in other Liv publications.
Nearly all of the Liv cultural characters participated in Liv literary life between the two World Wars – both radical Western Liv poet Uļi Kīnkamäg (1869–1932), who entered the Latvian prison because of his patriotic beliefs that emphasized the Liv nationalism, and who was therefore well known in the Latvian press as the King of Liv, as well as the late leader of the Liv Union, Didrõk Vālgamaa (1884–1968), the artist Jānis Belt (1893–1946) and the teacher Edgars Vālgamā (1912–2003) and several scientists, such as Lauri Kettunen and Oskar Loorits.
Given the number of readers, the most active time in Liv literature was just the interwar period.
But, as Peter Damberg's action demonstrates, the creation of Liv's literature continued after World War II, although the possibilities for its release were much more limited.
The poetry of some authors, such as Alfon Bertholdi (1900–1993) and Poulīn Kļaviņa (1918–2001), was also published in Estonian scientific publications.
However, most of the artworks that were made at the time were handwritten.
When Latvia restored its independence, the extradition of the Liv literature was revived.
Latvia is our fatherland
The Livonians also fought for freedom, as much as they were.
This is why our father country is lovely to us.
The capital city of Latvia is on the shore of the Great Väina river of Riga.
There is a state government.
The ships flying to the river Väina up to Riga.
They bring goods from foreign countries and carry goods from Latvia abroad.
Warships that protect the seaside of Latvia, where we, the Livonian, live, are also entering the treasury.
Rand
We live in Livonian villages.
Green forest, blue sea and white sandbows are the ones we see here every day.
Nowhere else is it so good for children to play as on the white beach.
It can also be picked up beach boxes.
Sometimes there are lots of them on the beach.
Boys stretch ships from pine cream, put them on masts, masts attach paper sails and let them water.
The wind pushes the ships away from the coast until they reach the flames where the waves turn them around.
If you only want to, you can go to the sea as well.
Great people can reach another, sometimes more than a third flame when floating.
The children can’t even get another sauce, because the drink is already too deep.
In the second part, the water is cooler than in the lower part.
On the other side of the sea you can see the islands.
However, the White Saaremaa Fire Tower looks almost always.
The ships flying the sea, and the ships of the fishermen are seen going to the sea, and the sea is coming.
The fishermen catch the most of the seas in buckets, silk and shrimp.
Sometimes there are also larger fish in the coastal nets, such as cod, pig, salmon and more.
Game
We go to the beach,
You go to the beach,
All the fishermen in our village go to the beach.
We go to the sea,
You go to the sea,
All the fishermen in our village go to the sea.
We go to the beach,
You go to the beach,
All the fishermen in our village go to the beach.
We go home,
You go home,
All the fishermen in our village go home.
Spring
Spring is late on the beach.
This is caused by sea ice that gives a cold.
But when spring is on, it’s also beautiful.
The Livonian thinks that as beautiful spring as it is on the beach, there is nowhere.
There are urvades on the trunk and trunk.
In apple gardens, trees blossom around which bees look for honey.
Here and there flying passes, the tonekurg stands on one leg in its nest, the walk falls, and the entire forest sounds like a bird song.
Rivers and streams are full of water and flow quickly towards the sea, playing on the volley.
Fishermen can go to the sea again and the animals are hunted again.
On the evening of that day, when cows have been in herds for the first time, shed water on herds so that cows give more milk.
Herds are thrown against.
Children are also involved in it, and this evening nobody dresses when kids have clothes wet.
The sun has disappeared in fear of winter,
We have been warming fish in a foreign country.
In the spring he returned to us,
When he came, he quietly drank the snow.
Don’t have winter cold, don’t have ice,
How far does the sea look, the sea is gone.
The fishermen are thrown into the sea again,
They also pull out full of fish.
Going to the sea, coming to the beach they will not forget it,
They brought their fishing hours to the sun.
Summer
If the day is on, there will be summer too.
On January night people go to the beach.
There's usually one old boat turning around, some dry trees assembled and they're put to the end of the fire.
I sing Japanese songs, but in Latvian.
Sometimes you hear a song in the coastal language too.
After the day of June, there will be a big hard working time - hein time.
Those who are far from weed can not get home every night, but often stay there too.
By summer, the Lions will be able to live in the beaches so that they can swim in the sea.
Fishermen are now beginning to catch the biggest lest.
Previously, fishermen pulled out the ropes manually, but now the ropes are much longer and coarse, and the lestanoods themselves are much bigger, so the ropes are now pulled out with a motorboat.
In the autumn, the sea is already shielding.
At a warm time, they are not caught.
Great joy is made for children in the summer when they can go to pick up and eat berries.
There are already strawberries, blueberries and raspberries.
The Rescue Song
Listen, children, I will tell you how you sing the passage:
She sings, “The Windshield!”
She sings, “Look!”
She sings, “Vidiit, windshield!”
She sings, “Vite, sir!”
She sings: “Vidiit, windshield, ambient,
gadget, gadget, gadget,
gadget, gadget, gadget,
“The circus!”
Autumn
When the crop is ready and moored, autumn begins.
Days are shorter and nights are longer.
He has long disappeared from his nest, and the songs are no longer heard.
They all flew away from us to a warm country with no snow or cold.
The forests are quiet, only scraping the stems are heard, and most of the evenings when they fly around the park, looking for a place to sleep in the trees at night.
The largest fishing time has arrived for fishermen.
They bring a shore, though, silk.
There is work on the beach all day.
Once the nets are cleaned, they will be discarded on the brave ones from where fishermen - barely able to eat - they will be taken off again so that they can be connected together and thrown into the sea again.
The air and also the seawater are cold, no one can swim anymore.
When cleaners cold their fingers, they make a fire on the beach on which to warm their hands or get warm on their own.
People rush up the ground to be ready for a new spring farm.
And when the potatoes are taken, the ground will also be frozen, the sea will produce an ice soup, the ice and the winter will be on hand.
Mother tongue
Rannakeel, my native language,
Sacred I have your sound.
For those who forget the coastal language,
Also forgets the mother’s word.
the Coastal language
old cast beaches,
sing songs in the coastal language,
God prayed.
We talk about the coastal language,
Because we love it.
Let's be like our fathers:
Livonian as rocks hard.
Winter
The cold and the snow is just rare on the beach before Christmas.
When Christmas with gifts for your sixes, candles and good kids is over, winter begins.
The weather is cold and the snow is raining.
The wheels are now laid on the shadow and everyone is driving along the white snow with sticks and boots.
Sometimes when a visit is eaten, the silver garden is also attached to a watch that sounds far away during winter.
In winter, children need to go to school and learn from the heart.
Once the schoolwork is done, it is time to go out to play, try the depth of snowhanges and make snowfall.
You can also drive along the valleys, and you can drop down the mountain with small swings, so that the wind will wind in your ears.
The sea is overlapping with ice and is often heard winding up the icebreaker when it runs through other vessels.
If there is a particularly cold winter, the ships will have to stay in place, the strong icebreaker will no longer be able to help.
Everyone waits for the spring and the sun that will melt away all the snow and ice.
Fight
Kirre päiksega
Try the strength, -
Northeastern clouds with snowfall
The sun covers.
between the cloud day
sends the sun again,
That means that there is water.
just snow.
Strange northeastern wind,
If you take away the cloud,
The sun is swollen
Victory over him.
The sun is green,
What else is the snow.
The sun remains the ruler,
The disappearance of the north.
Unevana
There was a dream home in the forest.
He had a huge wind in which he chilled from morning to night.
In the evening, the sleeping old took a large bag of sand and went to the children's sleep.
Fired down the window and looked - so late time already, but the boy is still playing on the floor!
He quickly took a good jacket of sleep from the bag and threw through the window to the boy's eye.
Now the boy's eyelids became hard and sleep began to squeeze in the corners of the eye.
When his mother saw it, she said, "0i, sleeping old, you're going to sleep on our Karl floor."
My mother took the boy to bed and took him to bed.
But the dreamer stepped forward with long steps, the dream went on for other children too.
Sleep
Large mice, small mice,
Bring your child your sleep through the room,
through the chamber,
through the cradle.
What I saw tonight
It was midnight when my sleep disappeared.
Everyone slept.
I heard about talking and layering in the second room.
I knocked out of bed and went to see.
I settled secretly between the door.
And what I saw!
Leena's doll and her mother's coffee shop held a wedding.
Both had roses of paper in the chest and the doll kept the coffee cans stuck from the sang.
The whole floor was full of weddings.
The band and the band made music, and everybody else was dancing.
The fireworks circulated with a pudding, the father's wool boots circulated with an oven robe.
They all wanted to dance in their legs.
Coffee and tea glasses rolled like yarn beams from one wall to another.
“Don’t make so much noise!” she dressed in a three-foot chair.
“People wake up, it’s fun.”
No one noticed this warning.
They laughed and danced for so long, until one café ran together with sugar.
The coffee came off the side of the ear and the sugar dish fell around.
The whole sugar was dissipated on the floor.
“Didn’t I say,” she whispered.
Everyone was afraid of it and everyone was running in their place.
I went back to bed.
In the morning, my mother thought the rats had done this madness.
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing, pillcake,
Dancing, dancing ever more.
Dancing with flax bone hazards,
Dancing, dancing ever more!
Every day is Sunday,
Every day is Dance Day,
You danced yesterday, today,
Dancing, dancing ever more:
Tomorrow you’ll dance again,
Dancing, dancing,
Summary.
Valter Lang: Baltic Finnish-White contacts based on archaeological and linguistic data.
The long and close contacts between the Algerian and the eastern white tribes resulted in the material and spiritual culture (including language) of these two groups of different languages.
The article focuses on some interesting connections in the culture of both groups, trying to explain and display language contacts with archaeological datasets.
First, a group of white borrowing words is considered semantially related to the original Baltic Finnish language with the aim of determining the time and place of borrowing them.
Then the most intense contacts that took place in the younger bronze period are described more closely, including analysing the possibility of deriving the name of West Sea Finnish Kalev/Kalev from the white word Kalvis/Kalējs with the meaning ‘sepp’, which was first justified by the author in one of his previous articles in Estonian (Lang 2012).
This topic finally leads to the manufacture of bronze and, in particular, bronze shoots by the same forks or minks, and the use of these shoots in sacrifice and taxation.
Petri Kallio: Historical phonology from baseline to baseline.
The article presents an attempt to reconstruct the approximate chronological follow-up (delayed) of key voice changes between the original Baltic Sea Finn and the original Liv language.
The side effect of this study is the reconstruction of the original Liv fonem system, with previous versions of which have been more fragmented and original.
Finally, the article briefly discusses when and where the original Liv language was spoken before it was distinguished into the Liv language of Kurzeme and Salat.
Patrick O’Rourke, Karl Pajusalu: Lines of Liv in Estonian murals.
The article deals with language updates that are characteristic of both Kuramaa and Salac Liv language and are also limited to Estonian murals.
Fonoological, morphological and morphosynthetic lines are looked at.
These languages appear mainly in western and southwest Estonia, especially near the current western border between Estonia and Latvia.
The more widespread Livonian lines can be mostly considered a characteristic development of western seasoome if these changes are not caused by contacts with German and white languages.
However, the lines known in the immediate proximity of the previous Liv language area are interpreted as a substitute of the Liv language in the west-east and the islands’ mural cells.
Kristi Salve: through Salaja Salat: Place names of Estonian songs relating to Livonian settlements.
The article seeks an answer to the question of whether there are references to the Livonian people in the Estonian reg.
Using the Estonian database of songs, the article tracks some names of lands, rivers and cities.
The name of Kuramaa turns out to be very popular; it appears, however, in various contexts, often determined by the subversion.
Wind Wind: The main features of the Liv language voting system and the pronunciation.
This article provides an overview of the Liv language voting system.
From the point of view of the Kuramaa Liv fractures, the largest difference is between the east and west Livs, while the Central Liv, the United Kingdom, is a transitional area.
The language of today’s Liv language is based on the Eastern Liv fracture of Kuramaa.
The article describes the standard pronunciation of the Liv, parallel to pointing out some breaking differences.
Vocals and consonants are described separately.
In addition, an overview of the Liv prosecution system is provided.
The Liv language is in some unique situation among the Finnish languages of the western sea, because the language has influences from the Latvian language that belongs to the Latvian language.
Unlike other Western Sea Finnish languages, the Liv language contains sound quiets and fricativis, which can also appear as long geminates.
Also, the Liv language is interesting in terms of the abundance of short and long monoftongs, diftongs and triftongs.
Tiit-Rein Viitso: Essitive in Liv.
In the Liv language, there are a small number of forms of expression expressing location or time, which can be evaluated as forms of the Western Sea Finnish essitive, or an existing movement, or be considered different from the usual forms of the Liv Dativ.
The article examines these questions where? and when? the corresponding forms of name, character, number, replacement, rate and reversal, as well as the corresponding forms of language, where? and by what time? and where? and what time? you turn forms and their matches and history in the Western Sea Finnish language space.
In addition, word forms formally similar to the dativ, but used as lubricants as forms derived from the dativ, and their types of use shall be identified.
Valts Ernštreits: Methods of enriching Liv vocabulary.
The article examines the ways in which the Liv vocabulary is enriched – combined words, borrowings, derivatives and translation loans.
It is observed that these possibilities of expanding vocabulary have been used effectively throughout the time of the development of modern Liv language, and that the creation of news words in Liv language has developed certain practices.
Thus, when creating new alliances, attention must be paid to the specific types of alliances that are dependent on the use of singularity or multiplication, including the end of historical genitivity or both of which are reversible.
The borrowing words in the Liv language mainly relate to internationalism, whose mediation language is Latvian, and the borrowing words must apply to the characteristics of the pronunciation and morphology of the Liv language.
Very productive in Livonian are derivatives formed with suffixes, but the use of prefixes, contrary to the common opinion at times, is strongly limited.
Many of the new concepts come into the Liv language as translation loans, which can distinguish between two major translation loans groups – translation loans created by Estonian and Latvian templates.
The Liv language word creation is currently a relatively limited subject that needs to continue working in this area.
Renāte Blumberga: Liv language in the 1930s letters: a look at the correspondence of the editors of the magazine “Līvli”.
The article shows, using the vocabulary samples of both editors Andris Štālers and Kōrli Stalte of the Liv language magazine “Līvli”, published in the 1930s, that new words can be found in the Liv language vocabulary.
The vocabulary samples provide an idea of what news and foreign words were used by the editors of “Līvli” in their correspondence and whether they coincide with the forms presented by the most recent source of lyrics – “Latvian dictionary” published in 2012.
On the basis of these examples, a brief analysis shall also be carried out on the basis of whether the word-writing method and alteration format in the dictionary are regular and whether there is a need for changes in this respect.
It is concluded that “in the Livonian-Estonian dictionary” fluctuations are observed in the alternate forms of words. This should be harmonised in the following groups of foreign words: 1) in the words the end of which in Latvian is -ar, -ar and -ar; 2) in the words the end of which is in Latvian -or, or, or, or, in the Livonian; 3) in the words the end of which is in Latvian -al, -al, and -al, 4) in the characteristic words the end of which is in Latvian -al and -al.
It was also concluded that the news words – especially those relating to international loans – have not adhered to certain principles of word creation.
The article also provides examples of foreign words that could complement the Liv Liv dictionary.
Christopher Moseley: Revitalising the community language: Livonian and other livonian communities.
This article compares efforts to use the oral language of two European languages that are no longer used daily: the Korean language in southwestern England and the Liv language in Latvia.
Various approaches have been implemented to encourage inheritance students to use these languages again, but there are also common lines and there is still something to learn from each other.
The work of the Korn Language Society in organizing language learning and motivating students has been compared to courses carried out by the Livonian Union Kolka Department in Kuramaa.
The Constitutional Committee became a major member of the 26 Constitutional Assembly.
It is clear that such a multi-headed group would be difficult to do specific practical brain work.
Therefore, it was decided to be divided into two subcommittees: one developing a draft state order and the other Declaration of Civil Liberties and Rights.
The first Sub­Committee is joined by 13 deputies and the energetic Fēlikss Cielēns is elected to be chairman (born 1888. in Riga county on the Vidzeme side, dying 1964).
He had deepened constitutional law and Western parliamentaryism while studying in Paris.
In 1915, the main principles of Latvia’s political autonomy were published.
Fēlikss Cielēns had obtained an extensive experience in education and political work: from 1906 to 1910 he studied law science at the University of St Petersburg, from 1912 to 1913 at the University of Paris and since 1904 participated in the revolutionary movement.
Since he was sentenced to death in 1906, he was forced to emigrate and for years in Brussels, Paris and Switzerland, committing to the press in the Cina newspaper and other socially democratic and democratic publications.
But at fatal moments for Latvia, he was present in the first row in the National Assembly, the Constitutional Assembly, the first, second and third in the Saeima, foreign missions and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The subcommittee led by him came up with key principles such as the central authority body of the country, parliament and its election, the President of the Republic and the Chairperson of the parliament, the government, the Prime Minister and Ministers, judges, the Auditor General, national referendums and amendments to the Constitution.
A detailed overview and analysis of the provisions was presented in September 1921 by Jānis Purgalis (born 1868. in Valka county, dying 1934).
He had studied legal science at the University of Moscow (1892–1896), became a conspiracies lawyer, elected vice president of the Latvian Society of Riga, vice president of the city government of Riga, an active organizer of houseowners in Riga and a representative of houseowners of Latvia at the Houseowners Forum of the Netherlands, Austria, Germany and Italy.

In addition, works based on its closures, such as the history of the English parliament, the foundations of the democratic state order and the bodies of the Latvian state authorities and their functions, come from it.
He contributes to building the state order of Latvia and gives a rightly optimistic assessment of what has been done with patriotic and professional clarity already in 1928, on the tenth anniversary of the country:
“The people of Latvia have been able to create a democratic constitution, develop and protect it, and we can be sure that the people will continue to do so in the coming decades and hundreds of years of the Republic of Latvia.”
Undoubtedly: The Constitution of Latvia was designed by the highest intelligence of Latvia, people representing rich culture.
Among them – our great spiritual characters, the ideological leaders of the statehood of Latvia through the years: Rainis and Aspazija, Kārlis Skalbe, Francis Trasuns, Andrejs Kurcijs and many others.
Rainis – Jānis Pliekšāns (born 1865) – a Latvian first-size speaker, graduated from the Law Faculty of St Petersburg University (1888), an attorney and notary, participated in the idea movement of the Latvian education community in the late century Uus Vool, incarcerated, sent to a forced labour camp to northern Russia (1899–1903), one of the inspirators of the 1905 Revolution, along with a living partner of Aspazija (from 1897), flew to Switzerland (1905–1920), enjoyed the idea of statehood of Latvia and supported the nation's spiritual development, education and democracy efforts, tirelessly published articles about Latvia and Latvians in the Swiss and German newspapers, contributed heavily to the development of Latvian poetry and dramaturgy, in 1919 greeted the creation of Latvia with the words “Tere, free Latvia!” With Aspa

In 1929 he died of a heart attack in Riga Jurmala.
Aspazija – Elza Pliekšāne (Rozenberga) (born in Jelgava county) – the first major Latvian female poet and drama market, a temperamental member of the New Voolu movement, whose life creedo is most brightly expressed in the words of the hero of the first romantic drama “The Priestrinna”: “My storm is / and I am just proclaiming!”
In the autumn of 1895, Aspazija would like to enter the Faculty of medicine at Zürich University, but health is pulling from the bottom, since 1896, an integral companion of Rainis in both expulsions and peaceful periods of life.
In the spring of 1920, both poets will return from Zurich through Warsaw and Daugavpils on 10 April in Riiga.
After a week, they will be elected as members of the Constitutional Assembly.
The poets are bright, but possibly subjectively portrayed by their party-mate Fēlikss Cielēns, describing Rainis's uncertain oratorial ability in the Speaking Poultry and Aspazija, who only spoke on individual occasions, but whose voice “was elective and clear, language flown without effort; there was no sentimental adjacent tone or artificial lyric decorations.
He spoke as a true fighter and was not ashamed to use irony to suppress the opponent.
This stormbreaker died, under pressure from health problems and depression, alone in Riga at the end of 1943.
Andrejs Kurcijs – Kurinskis (born 1884. Aizpute county, dying 1959) – a writer, a socialist, studied business science at the Riga Polytechnic Institute, philosophy and medicine at the University of Jena, Germany, obtained Dr.med. degree, then graduated from Kaasan University’s Doctoral Academy (1913) and supplemented himself in philosophy and art in Berlin.
He participated in the work of illegal socialist organisations, participated in the 1905 Revolution, became chairman of the Latvian Self-Determination Society (1918), elected to the National Assembly, the Constitutional Assembly and the Saeima.
Author of several modern poetry and prosecution books, authorities chase, incarcerate and prosecute him after the war (1949).
Français Trasuns (born 1864. in Rēzekne county) – a church teacher, a lighter, a socialist, studied at St. Petersburg’s Catholic Spiritual Seminar, graduated from St. Petersburg’s Mental Academy, served in Daugavpils, Riga, St. Petersburg, was sent to Vladimir for participation in the movement of the Latin awakening period, returns to a dotant and professor at a seminar in St. Petersburg (1902).
It is elected to the first Russian statesummer, participates in the organisation of the Latvian Congress (April-May 1927), supports the separation of Vitebsk from the Governorship of Latvia with its great authoritarians and alliance with the rest of Latvia.
Rainis states: “Francis Trasuns was the first latgale to search and find a path to understanding between the divorced parts of our people.” And the President of the Republic Jānis Čakste, at his expulsion in April 1926, says: “Francis Trasuns placed the third star in our Latvian coat – Latgale.” Such was the latgale – the Chairperson of the Temporary Council of Latvia (1917–1918), Member of the National Assembly of Latvia, the Constitutional Assembly, the First and Second Members of the Saeima.
Kārlis Skalbe (born 1879 in Cēsis) – a national school teacher, a beloved writer, a socialist, participated in the events of the 1905 Revolution, already then stepped out for independent Latvia, was forced to emigrate abroad, initially to Zurich, later to Finland and Norway.
Then returns to the country, continues to be socially active, commits primarily to the work of writers and journalists, one of the founders and first editors of the Great Journal of Latvia (19.07.1920–15.12.1925), directs the trade union of Latvian writers and journalists.
At a fateful time for the state of Latvia, a member of the National Assembly, the Assembly of the Establishment and the first four members of the Saeima are members.
In the autumn of 1944, one of the last refugee ships has been forced to leave home and move to the other shore of the Baltic Sea, Sweden, where he will die in Stockholm in spring 1945.
... so they and many others (that is not to say that all hundreds of fifty-two) were working out of the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia.
During this time, the peace agreement between Latvia and Russia is concluded in Riga and ends the War of Independence (11.08.1920), the Liaison on land reform of vital importance is adopted (partly from 16.09.1920 to 03.05.1922), in Buldur the Conference on the establishment of the Baltic Union (6.08 to 6.09.1920), which demonstrates that 1,6 million residents live in Latvia, allied countries recognise the Republic of Latvia de iure (26.01.1921), Latvia becomes a member of the National Association (22.09.1921), the mobilisation of its own money (03.08.1922, 1 latt = 0,2903226 grams of pure gold), the first elections of the Saeima (7.−8.10.1922), the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia, the first sitting is held by the Saeima (7.11.1922), the first President of the Republic of Latvia
Jānis Čakste admits when he finished the work of the Constitutional Assembly: "... We have finished our work.
We cannot decide on the goodness of our work, let the nation and the coming generations do it.
(...) The first legal representatives of the people of Latvia demonstrated that they were able to work in parliamentary form and that this work was unsuccessful.
The idea of the state of Latvia, the understanding of the necessity of the state of Latvia has strengthened hard among the people.
I think there is no one among us who would be against the idea of this country.
“Young Latvia, which we have built for two and a half years, is developing, blossoming and blossoming for our future generations.”
However, on 7 November 1922, when the artillery was poisoned, Jānis Čakste assesses the work of the artillery more historically: “Just at the moment the new constitution enters into force in the country of Latvia.
This new constitution introduces a new state order in Latvia, in part creates new governing bodies and defines more precise functions of existing and new bodies.
From this point of view, the new constitution is the basis on which our governing bodies and leaders can act better and fuller than it was possible so far.
We all hope and are sure that this new constitution will help us finally make Latvia legal and legal, and in the same way ensure the well-being and order of the people.
Make this new Constitution happy and strong for Latvia.”
The contribution of the people who are convinced of the idea of statehood of Latvia has now remained in the stenographs and the text of the Constitution, which is an expensive heritage for us.
This is the basis for a democratic, contemplated and harmonious country and for the lives of its citizens.
