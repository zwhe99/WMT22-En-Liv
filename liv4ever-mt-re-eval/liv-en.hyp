The six thing – Livonian war high school and Livonian her
From the Livonian Warrior School, which took place in 2013, its tradition is the similar photo of participants on the Livonian coast known as the Livonian tam.
From July 30, 2021 until August 8, Koštrõgõl was already the third Livonian war high school, which was established by LI Livonian Institute in partnership with the University of Tartu.
During the Liv Secondary School, its participants gathered with Liv language practising students, learned about Liv history, culture and modern day, as well as about Liv’s final landslide – the Liv Coast, which therefore became the Liv Secondary School event.
Already from the first Livonian Warrior School, which took place in 2013, its tradition is the similar photo of participants on the Livonian coast familiar with the Livonian tam.
The story of him is the elegance and wealth of Vaid village Lōz farm for more than two centuries.
Nika Polmaņ, the first teacher of Livonian education at Lōz Farm, was born (1823), from the 60s of the 19th century, here lived the family of Launitz – its former owner Andris Launitz in the 19th century wrote about Livonian politics and other traditions, Lōz Farm has been a sub-school for Livonian children (1923-1937).
On the end of the 30s of the 20th century, Alfon Berthold (1910–1993) became the owner of Lōz – a fisherman, a Liv poet, a researcher of national resources – and also the family of Berthold, who currently lives near Lōz.
Livonian war overseas school is over, but some moments of it is visible on Latvian TV.

Welcome to the newly updated website!
The Livonian population of Latvia originated from the Baltic Sea Somalia has played a major role in the contemporary Latvian culture and culture of Latvia.
Hispanic Latvian language has arisen in the congregation of the Livonian and ancient white people – the Latgalds, the undergalds and the Kurds – and is based on the sole sound of the Latvian language.
The experience of the Livonian people is also visible in several Latvian traditions and contemporary cultures from folklore to food.
Therefore, Livonian culture is also included in the Latvian cultural canon and the preamble of the Constitution of Latvia or the Constitution specifically emphasizes the tradition of Livonia in the birth of a part of the Latvian people.
The Livonian has traveled so far not only to practise its traditional language and culture, but also to develop it, and now the Livonian hispanic culture is one part of the modern culture of Latvia.
The Liv language is the Ural watchim Baltic Seattle group language, otherwise than the Latvian language, which is the Indo-European watchim white language group language.
The closest members of the Liv language are Estonian, Finnish and Cartene, the most remote are the Finnish, Hungarian, mordva and other Ural language.
The Liv language is found in UNESCO’s World Warned Language Atlas (UNESCO Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger).
In Latvia, the status of the Liv language has been established in Section 4 of the State Language Act, which states: “The State shall care for the skills, protection and development of the Liv language as initiators (autohtons).
The Liv language as part of Livonian culture has since 2009 also been found in the Latvian Culture Cannon.
In the 19th century, about 3,000 people spoke in Livonian language, there were 1,500 speakers in the mid-20th century, but about 30 people in the world can speak between Livonian and Livonian.
All the time, the number of those who have studied the Liv language is also growing.
The learning of the Liv language is important for the understanding of the Latvian language, because both languages have long understood each other in working together.
While there are few speakers, the Liv language is important for the students of Ural languages, because it is inherent and many old ummites are found in it.
The knowledge of the Liv language is also important for the Liv language itself, because of which the Liv language has always been the basis of the knowledge of the Livs.
Today, every person can learn the Liv language in their own, courses and fields, as well as in several iconic schools.
It should be prayed that in the future the Liv language can also be studied in the network.
The Livonians are akin to not only the enthusiast language and history, but also the rich and local cultural heritage that can be recognized in the section of the Portal’s Irdi Culture.
The Livonians have also developed and developed their contemporary culture – art, music, as well as writers who went to the sea almost 200 years ago.

Viktor Berthold — Livonian, fisherman and healer — 100
Viktor Berthold (1921–2009) was the last of those whose family, while his wife Marta (s. Liedane, 1925–1994) was still alive, the daily language was Livonian, and also the last one to speak to in her native coastal language.
On January 16, 2021, we remember Viktor Berthold at his 100th anniversary.
Viktor Berthold lived in Kolkata for a long time.
As a Liv thing, he mostly began working lately, when the knowledge of Liv language was limited and the skill of each language was exceptionally valuable.
In the early 90s Viktors, together with Marta, taught the Liv language for survivors.
While Viktor was still in power, from August to the first day he was always visible in the Livonian torture in Mazirbe.
Viktor Berthold was born on January 16, 1921, in the family of Kōrli and Berthold Bertholdõd in Vaid village Zūonkõ.
On Zūonkõ Farm, six tribes lived in a wide and vish Liv family – Bertholds, where several people grew up important for the history of Liv culture.
Both together with his brother Alfon Berthold (Livonian poet, folklore narrator) they, growing up, practised the Liv language all their life.
Just from the Bertholdide family, the best Liv language speakers came in the 21st century.

Although the family of Viktors and Marta Bertholdid was the last family on the beach who used the Liv language when talking between themselves, both children did not learn the Liv language.
Since 1995, Ārija Berthold, who lives together with her daughter in the U.S., remembered so:
Liv language was told at our home.
Also when parents didn't want children to understand what they were talking about.
I wanted to learn the Liv language.
Now I know only a few words and there have been some songs left to mind.
I think I would be able to read because I remember that my mother taught me how to read onlauts.
Then, when I asked him why I was not taught the Liv language, he said to the contrary that it was the kind of walk that was suppressed, which was not allowed to speak.

The 2008 war was the first that Viktor's place on the bench in the Livonian pivots remained empty.
Viktor Berthold went to any rest when he was eighty-eight years old on 23 February 2009.
He vacations in Kolkas cemetery.

Final word
The Liv language is a ancient Finnish-Ugandan language that originates from Latvia.
In the 12th century, the Liv language was spoken in Latvia in the midst of a small sea or Riga livestock region, also in Latvia’s current place around Riga.
The people who lived there sat together with the weddings and only spent their language in Latvian.
In the mid-19th century, the Liv language was spoken only in two places.
One of them was on the edge of the Little Sea on the west of the St. Louise, where 22 Liv language practising students used the Central or Salat Liv language.
Here the Liv language disappeared in a very short period.
The second place was the Livonian coast – 14 Kurzeme fishermen from Patic to Gipkõ, where 2,500 people spoke the Liv language of Kurzeme.
In the 20th century, the number of Liv speakers also remained less in Kurzeme.
It was denied by both World Wars and the occupation of the Council, which made the pain of language even faster, although the Livonians themselves and their supporters from among other Finnish-Uganda people and Latvia did a lot of work to promote and develop it.
In the 1950s, a separate regime was established throughout the Liv coast, because it was now the western border of the Soviet Union.
Fishing, which had long been the most common for the Livonian people, and getting to the beach was even more difficult.
This is why many of the sailors went to search for work in the vast city of Riga and Ventspils.
The beaches were thrown empty, and the last piece of land in which the Liv language was told in spiders disappeared.
Instead of the western Livonians, Latvians often arrived and now the Livonian coast is almost free to listen to Latvian.
Paldis Livs live in Riga, Ventspils, Kolkas and also in other places in Latvia.
A 2011 population reading showed that there are 250 Livonians in Latvia together.
Today, the Liv language is written in the Atlantic of UNESCO Earthquakes.
There are only a little more than 20 people in Mazirbe who can speak Livonian.
There are also three poets among them, who are also the authors of this book.
Therefore, although Livonian writers represent Europe in favour of the smallest number of writers, it can also be the largest if they look at the number of writers among Livonian and Liv language speakers.
The understanding and importance of the Liv language and culture are much greater than only the number of current Liv or Liv speakers.
The Livonian has played an important role in the history of Baltic countries and a significant part in the contemporary Latvian and Latvian culture.
Among the well-known writers, composers, artists, officials and other educated people of Latvia, there are many people who come from Livonian.
The Livonian has also been a solid skill in self-isolation and attraction, which has helped the Livonian language and culture continue to live today.
It is also important that Livonian culture has also developed its modern culture alongside its traditional culture for nearly two centuries.
In terms of the length of its history, it is similar to the modern cultures of the Livonian nationals – Latvians and Estonians.
This means that the Livs have not only practised the use of their language until now, but also developed literary and contemporary cultural traditions visible in the works of modern Liv poets, artists, music writers and singers.
Beginning with Liv writers
The first Liv language words are found in the cronicle of Livonian Henrik, which is an important document for the history of Livonian and all Baltic countries.
The first Liv language texts were pressed already in the 16th century.
However, the vast majority of the Liv texts published earlier in the mid-19th century were primarily only samples of the language that were not intended for Livonians, including the first Liv language books forced in London in 1863 – the translations of the Matthew evangelium in the east and west part of the Kurzeme Liv language.
The first book, which was designed specifically for the Livonian people - the same translation of the Matthew evangelium, which was made with two previous translations - was published only in Peterburg in 1880.
The first demonstrations with Livonian beauty magazines took place already in the mid-19th century, when Peterburg academys Anders Johan Sjögren and Ferdinand Johann Wiedemann came to the Livonian.
The first Liv grammar compiled by them along with Livonian samples and the Livonian-German-Livonian dictionary was published in Peterburg in 1861.
Other samples of the language (names, folk songs and ancestors) include the first samples of Liv writers - poetry written by John Prince and his son Peter Prince.
The parent of Jāņ Prints was a Livonian fisherman and studied a writer from the village of Miķeļtornis, where he also held a virgin office for several years.
Later, the parents of John Prince went to live in Ventspils, where he laid the base of one of the cities of Ventspils (in full – Ostgals, where one of the votes carries his name too).
The Prince of John lived there until the end of his life.
He had the talent of a great linguist and writer.
It is characterized by the words of the Livonian, created by him, which he refers to the students of the grief, and by his articles in the Latvian newspaper of the time.
Just before the arrival of Sjögren and Wiedemann, John Prince had written several courses in Latvian and Livonian languages.
He had already made translations too.
The parents of the Prince of John had the idea of practicing the beautiful, clean and rich Liv language for future relatives and indicating that the Liv language is the same cultural language as any other major European language.
It is supposed that according to this idea the parents of John Prince could also write their first poems in Liv language and make first translations.
The Prince of John is also important for Latvian writers.
His Latvian poetry of the Sacred Songs and prayers of the Seamen, which he wrote along with his eldest son John, was published in Jelgavas in 1845.
It was the second original collection with Latvian-language writers in history.
Reading the works of John Prince, written more than 170 years ago, you can only wonder how his language is used by him, even how good and transparent the images and rites of his poetry are.
The texts written by him also put the thought that history could have been different as well.
If the Prince of John had been able to learn more about cultural life in us, not only fishermen’s villages in the world, but would have known a remarkable and bright 19th century cultural man, not only in Latvia and Baltic countries, but may also be in the context of a healthy Europe.
Livonian writers in the 20th century
Livonian writers began to grow quickly after the First World War, when national romantic ideas in the 19th century had become very popular and, after the pain of large empires throughout Europe, many new national governments were suddenly formed.
When the new independent countries of Latvia, Estonia and Finland formed the rush of the former Russian Empire, the Livonians, which were an important part of the history of this region, were again taken to the centre of attention.
Livonia received the attention of various students and cultural work makers from Estonia and Finland.
They were understood by the idea of relatives – the family of several people who speak Finnish-Ukraine languages – in Europe, where the Indo-European languages are generally spoken freely.
The work of these students and cultural work-makers was also understood by the fact that other such Finnish-Ukraine people, without counting the Sāms and Hungarians, were hard to provide for research or collaborative work, because they had only been created by the EU of the Soviet Union.
Therefore, the various interests of Finnish and Estonian students were suddenly devoted to the Livonian people, they started working with the Livonian research and deny, and the Liv language and culture were greatly supported by both of these people.
Lauri Kettunen (1885–1963) was the first and most important of such students who arrived on the Liv coast – the Finnish, the Liv-German dictionary published in 1938 – and the Estonian Oskar Loorits (1900–1961), the student of the Liv folklore of the time and the obsession.
Alongside the collection of Liv language and cultural materials, both students in Livonian films in 1920 began talking about the fact that Livonians should pay more attention to their belongings, they should be practised and developed.
Therefore, they also refused to create and develop Livonian cultural life – to build song courses and the Livonian Union, to educate Liv language in schools, etc.
One of the most important works of these students was the creation of the ability to issue Liv language texts.
Already in 1921 Kettunen and Loorits issued the first Liv reading book and shared such reading books until 1926.
The Liv poems and narratives were also published in one of the collections with folklore and authors reading their articles.
These books and later published in the magazine Līvli (1931–1939) were advocated for the development of Liv writers, in which, between the two World Wars, their works were published as well as by new writers.
It should be noted that at the time and also through the most popular part of Liv history with writers has been poetry.
Its allies are well understood, because poetry has always been a popular one at Liv's wedding people.
It was easy to hand out and for it and also needs less work than to write stories.
It was an important thing for many Liv writers, who were main fishermen and worked through the days more with airs and nets than with market and paper.
The most notable author at the time was Kōrli Stalte (1870–1947) – a poet, translator, practising and developing the Liv culture.
Stalte was also the first leader of the Liv Union, founded in 1923.
In addition, Stalte was the editor of the magazine Livonian (1933–1939) and also a translator who translated the New Testament with Livonian.
The most recognizable Stalte is in favour of writing worldly and spiritual livonian poems as well.
Stalte began writing already before World War I.
In the 1920s and 1930s, he was the fastest Liv poet and also the author of the first Liv language poetry (Livonian songs; Tallinn, 1924).
In his works, he speaks most about Livonian daily life, he writes about Livonian people and spiritual things.
All his poems are diverse – among them there are both simple folklore poems and fine sonics of children.
Kōrli Stalte is particularly noticeable because many of his poems have also been texts of songs at the same time (he is also the author of Livonian hisn words).
It can also be said about many other Liv poets.
Therefore, singers are often almost solid when they sing folk songs, although some Liv poets have written the words of these songs.
On the end of the 1930s Stalte also compiled a manuscript of the Liv reading book, which was published only in 2011, which was the Year of Liv language and culture between the Nationals.
Kōrli Stalte's poetry, based on this book, is one of the best examples of Liv writers.
It can also be said about the stories written by Stalte, which are even originally written for children, but showcasing the countryside during their writings in both an everlasting and genuine manner and in the use of good and beautiful Liv language, that their reading is a true joy for any Liv language learner.
Both the images of Livonian villages’ daily lives and the lives of us at the time are visible here.
However, the first Liv proza samples were published a little earlier, in the third Liv reading book (1923).
It was compiled by August Skadiņ and the publishing of the book was supported by the Estonian Sweet Society (Estonian Karskusliit).
The book included a number of alcohol stories, which he had written on his own.
In 1935, Peter Damberg was forced to compile a Mother Language Reading Book for school and home, one of which came from one of the most important books at the time.
In addition to the translations, the poems and narratives of Liv writers are included in this book, one part of which Damberg has written himself.
Pētõr Damberg was very important for Liv writers and contemporary culture.
He had several offices: wrote and translated into Liv language poetry, gathered and translated Liv folklore, developed Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonia
He practiced Livonian cultural life during the occupation.
In the 1930s Damberg participated in the publication of the magazine Livonian teachers’ seminar.
Pētõr Damberg mostly wrote poetry.
His poems have an unusually wide use of the Liv language and a multilingual meltdown.
He also wrote several stories of his memorials, one of the best Liv proza samples.
In 1967 Damberg also compiled a manuscript of a new Liv reading book.
This includes samples of social realism of the Constitutional period, which are not included in other Liv writers.
Nearly all Livonian cultural people took part in the lives of writers during the two World Wars: West Livonian poet Uļi Kīnkamäg (1869–1932), who was in the prison house for his Livonian ideas and whom in Latvia therefore also known as the name of the “Levonian King”, the head of the Livonian Union obbimi, Didrõk Vālgamaa (1884–1968), the artist Jānis Belt (1893–1946), the church of Edgars Vaalgamaa (1912–2003) and many other Livonian students such as Lauri Kettunen and Oskar Loorits.
Speaking in favour of the number of writers, the most active time for the Liv writers was between the two World Wars.
However, as has been seen from the sample of Peter Damberg, the creation of Livonian writers was divided even after World War II, although the possibility of its release was so far warranted.
Some of the authors, such as Alfon Berthold (1900–1993) and Poulīn Kļaviņa (1918–2001), were published in direct publications in Estonia.
However, the vast majority of the works written at the time remained handkerchief.
When Latvia returned to its independence, the release of Liv language writers went on again.
Latvia is our father country
The Livonians also fought for his freedom, how many of them were with the Latvians.
Therefore, our father country is lovely to us.
The main city of Latvia is Riga, on the edge of the river of Great Venus.
There lives the State of Sales.
While in Venice ships go up to Riga.
They bring goods from debted countries and to trade in Latvia to foreign countries.
The warships that protect the coast of Latvia in which we, the Livonian, live will also enter Venice.
Random
We live on the Livonian shores of the sea.
Green forest, blue sea and white sand legs are the ones we see here every day.
As good playing as in white beach sand there are nowhere for children.
There can also be picked up beach cakes.
Sometimes there are very many on the edge of them.
The men do pine lion ships, put them on masts, sail to masts from paper, and put them to beat.
The wind drives ships away from the weather until they get on the marvel, where waves melt around them.
If you only want, you can also go to the sea to hunt.
Great people can go around the rest, sometimes even about the third marvel.
The children won't get another horror until, the joke is already too deep.
In another drink, the water is more wool, not in the bottom of the drink.
If there is a clear weather, the sea can be seen on the other side.
The boom of the Baltic Sea shines almost ever more.
Aside from the sea, ships go, and fishermen see the waves go to the sea, and come some time.
Fishermen bring most butts, rears and blueberries from the sea.
Sometimes even larger fish such as turkeys, guises, salmons and others are in the weather.
Game
We go to the beach,
go to the beach you,
all the fishermen of our village go to the beach.
We go to the sea,
you go to the sea,
All fishermen of our village go to sea.
We're going to swim,
time to go to you,
all fishermen of our village go to time.
We go home,
Go home you,
All fishermen of our village go home.
Springs
Springs are late on the beach.
This is done by ice in the sea, which gives a cold.
But when spring is at you, it's also beautiful.
Livonia thinks that there is not as beautiful spring as anywhere on the beach.
Places and fun have canals.
The umbrellas bloom trees that surround the nicknames, searching for a barrel.
The rescuers are flying on and on the other side, the sanctuary stands on one foot in its nest, the keg swings and the entire forest swings from the birdland.
Rivers and streams are full of water, they flow with a fast flow to the sea side, noiseing with their goose.
Fishermen can go to sea again and animals are hunted.
When the goats have been in herds for the first time, they get to have more milk, herds guilty in the evening.
The marijuana swings against it.
Children will also be attended at the woman and this evening everyone will not be upset if children have wet clothes.
As the winter nights were feared,
have been visiting fishermen on foreign land.
The springs he has come back to us again,
When he comes, he has quietly drank the snow.
Yara consumed the winter cold,
and how far can we see the sea of our eyes open now.
Fishermen are now throwing into the sea nets again,
with the fish they are pulled out afterwards.
When heading to the sea, the time they will not forget about it,
that brought them to the sun's work.
The war
When John's Day is at you, there's also a war.
For Johns, people go to the beach.
There is some old boat rounded, some rains worn together and they will be added to the fire.
The songs are songed in John’s songs, but in English.
In the past, some of the songs in the coastal language are also heard.
After John's Day, there will immediately be a big, heavy working time, grass time.
Soups have remote weeds, they can't even get home every night and often sleep over the night as well.
Across the war, city residents come out to live in shore shores so that they can swim in the sea.
For fishermen, too, the biggest button stretching time is now occurring.
Previously, fishermen pulled out ropes with their hands, currently the ropes are many pitches and coarses, too, butt wire itself is much larger, and ropes are now watered out with motor vehicles.
In the autumn of the summer, already sea brews are occurring.
Just if during a warm time, they aren't fishing too much.
The great joy for children in the summer is that they can go up to collect and see.
Strawberries, mushrooms and beans are already ready.
Rescue song
Listen to the children, I will tell you now how to sing the beacon:
he sings, “Lord!”
He sings, “Lord!”
He sings, “Vitch the villain!”
He sings, “Vitch the king!”
he sings: “Vitch villain, vitch villain,
Witch Witchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitchwitch

The char!"
The Six
When field resources are ready and weeded, the autumn begins.
Suns become short and night long.
The sacred bird has already disappeared from its nest and the singing birds have no longer been heard.
They are all gone from us to warm lands where there is no snow and no cold.
The forests are quiet, only the whales roaming is heard most evenings as they barely fly, looking for a place where they can sleep in tree lads nightly.
Fishermen have known the greatest fishing time.
They bring time even burrows, even rears.
There is work on the beach all day.
When the nets are purged, they get vacant spread, and fishermen only forced to eat, take them down again to get ahead of a heart and a new shot.
The night and also the water in the sea have become cold, the water can no longer exist.
When jarring fingers cold, they make a fire on the beach where they can wash their hands and warm up themselves.
The people rush up the ground to kindergarten so that they are ready for seedling next spring.
And when the potatoes are picked up, the ground is frozen, the sea occurs soak, after the jet, and the winter is at you.
Mother language
Rand language, my native language,
holy to me is your voice.
Who can forget the coastal language,
Also forget the word of your mother.
Rand language spoke
old hard seaweeds,
songs in the coastal language sang,
in the coastal language God prayed.
Speaking Rand language
because of the soup; –
be like our fathers:
Livonian like stones hard.
Winter
The village and the snow are on our Livonian coast sometime before the stadium.
If they have been along with their sixths, tears and talents for good children, then winter begins.
The weather will become cold and snow will fall.
Ratings are now vaccinated and all rides with rages and ups along the snow of the country.
Sometimes, when someone kisses the sound, the watch will also be connected to the horse's swirl, which will sound farther during the collaps.
Over the winter, children need to go to school and study closely.
To do the work of the school, then it is time to go out to play, to weather the snowed stump and to make snowmoms.
While the errors can also be run with jets and with small rags can be shot from the mountain as winds hug one along the coronavirus.
The sea is occurring full of jets and it is often heard that the jet-goat tourers are driving other vessels through jets.
If it is an exceptionally cold winter, the ships must stay in place, then also a strong jet sailor will no longer be able to help.
Everyone waits for spring with the sun that will close off all snow and ice.
Winning
East with the sun
forces try, -
east clouds with snow
day coverings.
Stands in between the sun
sunshine
sends, it does as the water remains
just to snow.
Draw to the east as it continues
out of the stands,
the sun will swell
about his winemaker.
The sun is green,
which still covers snow.
The sun is changing,
I have to go.
Unage
Distance in the forest was an old home.
There was a great windshield for him, where he cooled a fine sleeper until the evening when he began to drink.
The night's sleep age took a big bag of full sand and went for children to sleep.
Come down Kōrliz's window and look – so wait already and the guy is still playing on the floor!
He quickly took a good jacket of sleep from the bag and threw eyes through the window to the boy.
Now the boy stayed eyebrows with difficulties, the dream began to sneak in the eyes.
When my mother saw it, she said: "Oh, sleeping old, you're indulged on our Kōrli floor."
Taken the boy in the knees and five in the bed.
But the sleeping age stepped forward with long centuries, the sleep went down to other children as well.
Unloul
Large mice, small mice,
Bring the baby to sleep
through the house, through the castle,
through the scalp.
What I saw tonight
It was halfway that the dream went off.
Everyone slept.
I heard talks and litigation in another room.
I rose out of bed and went to watch.
I stood between closed doors.
And what I saw!
A slow pile and a mother kept a lady as a cafe.
Both had roses of paper at the chest and the pitch kept a cafe at the handset.
The casualties were full of floor.
The boat and laid did two musics, the rest all the gifts.
The Sidtans turned into a hillside, the father's filters jumped with a cychibīsh.
Everyone confused in the valley of the right leg.
Cafés and jewellery swirled like turns from one wall to another.
“Are you doing so much noise!” roiled the grandmaughter, three-five chair.
"From the people awaken, then there's a fitch over."
But that was not noticed by anyone.
As many nagris and gifts were spent while one café ran together with a sugar stew.
The coffee went off the grey side and the sugar spill fell around.
All the sugar on the floor spread.
“Didn’t I say!” potched an old mother’s chair.
Everyone was very terrified and ran into their place.
I flooded back in the loyalty.
The mother thought in the morning that the spores had done it too.
Danny, dancist souvenir
Danny, dancist souvenir,
dancing, dancing;
dancing alongside the chest and care,
dancing, dancing alone!
Every day on Sunday,
every day dance day,
Eagle gifts, today gifts,
dancing, dancing;
tomorrow the same again gifts,
Danny, dancist souvenir,
With a bucket.
Valter Lang: White Sea salts-white connections on the basis of archaeology and linguistic activities.
The long-term connection between the Baltic Sea and the Western Baltics took place between the material and spiritual culture (near languages) of these two parts of the separate language community.
The series concentrates both cultures on some interesting links, trying to sew and prove archaeological knowledge with both.
In most cases, the words taken from white languages will be taken into some semantil groups for the purpose of defining the time and place of performing them.
Thistag will be mad with the most intense, during the youth book, looking at the possibility of sewing the white sea salt from Kalev/Kaleva bale from the word Kalvis/kalējs ‘siepā, Kīnkamäg’, as the author first built it in Estonian (Lang 2012).
As a result, it will lead to the backing of the theme book and the various book books on the part of the same soups and the use of their books at the end of the uprising and the taking of charges.
Petri Kallio: Istological phonology from the beginning of the white sea salt to the beginning of the Liv language.
The series will be cancelled to reconstruct the main fragments between the nearest chronological order (obusiness) between the prevalence ceasefire and the prevalence language.
The purpose of this analysis is to reconstruct the system of primary backgrounds, whose previous verses have been fragmentational and Irish.
The decision will be briefly discussed on the date and where the language of the e-learning language was discussed before reading the Liv language of Kuramaa and Salat.
Patrick O’Rourke, Karl Pajusalu: Livonian-made in an Estonian monastery.
The series looks at the language updates that are native to both Kurzeme and Salate Livonian and have also been recognized in the pursuit of the Liv language.
Views receive phonologic, morphologic and morphosintactic visions.
They come forward mainly in Vegetable and Reuters-Eastland, most of Estonia and Latvia close to the current western border.
The wider livonian visions can be a major part of the nature of the vegetative white sea salt on the western side when their cause is not contacts with the germ or white sop.
In the court of the former Livonian territory, the eyes of loved ones are translated into the substructure of the Liv language in the Estonian language in the west and east of the east.
Kristi Salve: Sallize through Sallize: Livonian site numbers in Estonian eldest ro’vlōl.
Written seeks answers to the question whether there are signs about Livonian in Estonian eldest ro’vl.
In the article, using Estonian older folk songs in a dated library, you can view some names of lands, rivers and cities.
The name of Kurzeme is very popular, although it comes ahead in none of these contexts, which are often lioned from the subterranean.
Tuuli Tuisk: Livonian film systems and sound mainstreams.
To take this article is a review of the system and sound of the Liv language films.
The vast majority of the coronavirus is between east and west, the central part, or Īra, is a crossing break.
The foundation of modern liv language is an ideal break.
A standard image of the Liv language will be seen in the series, bringing some breakaways out of the paralel.
Self-killers and co-killers are treated separately.
The system of the prosody of the Liv language is yet to be studied.
The Liv language is a characteristic among the white Sea salt languages that there is a sense of Latvian.
Secondly, as in a large part of the white Sea salt languages, the Liv language contains strong and rigid co-killers in the voice, which can also be imagined as long double films.
The Liv language also contains many shorts and pitches of simultaneous, double and triple self-isolators.
Tiit-Rein Viitso: In Liv language.
In the Liv language, there is a small space or time for samples of word forms that answer questions in which place? and ever? and after its end, there are esive witch forums like such forums in other white Seattle languages.
Written by these forums, they closely questioned where to place? ever? and from what place of year? answers the forums of lavish, excise and sublative witches, and their istorial.
It is still received as existing forums from unlagated dative formats in terms of form with them identity formats used as adverbials of statehood, and clearing the webs of their use.
Valts Ernštreits: Methods of faulting the Liv vocabulary.
The series examines the faults of the Liv vocabulary – short words, leasings, notes, picks and stalks.
These methods of degradation of vocabulary are understandably used even throughout the healing period of modern Liv language and there are also strong traditions of creating new words in Liv language.
Thus, at the creation of new union words, you have to think about using the single-number and multi-number union word label section and the same about the individual orders of the union words that include the end of the historical genius or where both parts are weakened.
The lines in the Liv language are primarily free to connect with the words between people, where the speaker of the Liv language is Latvian, and the names of the Liv language must be scrambled with the voice of the Liv language and the morphology of the Liv language.
Very daunting are the measures in the Liv language, which are in the form of suffixes, the use of prefixes is inconsistently warranted to the view of the wider divorce.
Many new understandings come into the Liv language as translation lines; in addition, the two largest translation lines – the translation lines created by Estonian and Latvian music – can be reduced.
Livonian word poetry is limited to research on themes where more deep knowledge is needed. However, the array of damage to the workpiece so far provides a versatile example for the future development of Livonian vocabulary.
Renāte Blumberga: Liv language in the 1930s: look at the writers of the magazine “Līvli”.
The series shows both editors Andris Štāler and Kōrli Stalte in the course of the magazine “Līvli” published in the 1930s, finding evidence of vocabulary in both ways that, even so far, linguistic research in low-used sources or finding new words to supplement the Liv vocabulary.
The samples of the Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonian Livonia
On the basis of these evidences, a brief analysis will be given whether the writing of words and the forums of witches in the dictionary are legal or there is a need for evidence in them.
It has been emphasized that “in the Livonian-Estonian-Latvian dictionary” is visible in the form of false words. This should be unified in these types of odd words: 1) the word of matter, where the end of the Latvian language is in the language of the Latvian language; 2) the word of the matter, where the end of the Latvian language is in the language of the Livonian language; 3) the word of the matter, where the end of the Latvian language is in the language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language of the Latvian language.
It has yet to be pierced that rebuilding wars - especially between people - have not adhered to strong principles of expression.
Here are some examples of debts that can complement the Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv Dictionary.
Christopher Moseley: The rebuilding of the society: Livonian and other livonian societies.
The series combines livelihood certificates in two European languages that are no longer used every day: they are the Korean language in western England and the Liv language in Latvia.
The differences between close proximity are used as a milestone to re-use these languages, but there are similar visions and at the same time there is something to learn from each other.
The Corn Kell Union is working at the motivation of language learning and the motivation of the Livonian Union in Kurzeme.
The Constitutional Committee was broad – there were 26 members of the Constitutional Assembly.
It is clear that the performance of such a large bar of concrete, practical mindwork would be complicated.
Therefore, it was decided to be part of two Sub­Committees: one makes a project of statehood, the other makes a declaration of civil liberties and rights.
So the first Sub­Committee received 13 members, and Fēlikss Cielēns (since 1888., in the middle of Riga, died in 1964) was elected as its leader.
During his time, studying in Paris, he had studied constitutional rights and Vegetable parliamentism.
Already in 1915, thinking about the political autonomy of Latvia, he issued the principles of his statehood.
Fēlikss Cielēns had obtained general education and also worked politically: from 1906 to 1910 he studied rights at Petõrburg High School, from 1912 to 1913 at the University of Paris, and from 1904 he participated in a revolutionary movement.
The 1906 War Court signed his death sentence, which is why he had to flee and live for years in Brissel, Paris and Switzerland, to release his samples in the Journal of Fight, other socially democratic and democratic publications.
However, at the time of decision-making for Latvia, he was in the National Assembly, the Constitutional Assembly, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd Saeima, the U.S. missions and the U.S. Ministry.
The Sub­Committee led by it came out with principles such as the central authority of the State – parliament and its elections, the President and the Chairperson of the State, the Cabinet, the Minister of Ministers and Ministers, judges, the Controller of the State, referendums, amendments to the Constitution.
The wider review and analysis, according to the articles, along with Mr Skujenieks in September 1921, was given by Jānis Purgalis (born 1968 in the Valka district, died in 1934).
He had studied the right at Moscow High School (1892–1896), became a dominant advocate, elected the chairman of the Latvian Society of Riga, the chairman of the city of Riga, an active organizer of housewives in Riga and Latvia, the delegate of housewives in Dutch, Austria, Germany and Italy.
After the Constitutional Assembly – Member of the 1st Saeima.

Arveds Bergs (since 1875 in Riga) – a lawyer and a well-known community worker, graduated from Tartu High School Faculty of Law and immediately after the high school worked in Petõrburg district court and the Court of Justice, according to the Latvian Society of Riga, was the head of the Baltic Journal, the Dzimtenes Journal and other publications, the organizer of progressive intelligence, noted the author of articles about the international situation of Latvia and the French, German, English and Russian languages.
Kārlis Ulmanis, in the third authority, was the Minister for Affairs, Delegation of the Paris Peace Conference, Deputies of the Constitutional Assembly, 1st and 2nd Saeima.
After the occupation of 1940, arrested, spent on the Soviet Union and landed in the Orenburg prisonhouse on 19 December 1941.
Pauls Kalniņš (born in Jelgavas aprinka 1872) – studied at the University of Moscow and at the University of Tartu as a doctor, enjoyed socializing ideas, about it being driven away from the Baltics, worked as an assistant at the Zurich Clinic, wrote in German social democrat newspapers about civic strikes in Belarus. In 1906, he returns to Latvia, shares treatment, while also works in the field, writing to the publishers, among them to the social democrat newspaper “Cinema”.
Starting the first World War, the star mobilises and he works as a military physician in both Helsinki and the front of Riga.
In 1918, together with Fricis Menders, Marģers Skujenieks, Kārlis Ulmanis, Pauls Kalniņš, he prepares and sends a German reichsta society resolution about independent Latvia.

This new Constitution brings a new system to Latvia, it creates one part of new authority organs and, more vividly, lays down their duties for both the former and the new organs.
From this point of view, this new Constitution will be the basis for which persons with state institutions and authority can act better and more completely, not as it has had wins before.
We all hope, and all the glue is firm that this new Constitution will help us to build the law and lawfulness of Latvia and thus the good condition and order of the nation.
Let this new state Constitution make Latvia happy and stronger!”
The appointment of the people who were strong about the ideas of the statehood of Latvia has now remained stenographed and the text of the Constitution as an expensive reminder to us.
It is the basis for the life of a democratic, promoted, harmonic country and the lives of its citizens.
