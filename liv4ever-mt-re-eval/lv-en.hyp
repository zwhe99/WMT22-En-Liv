Welcome to Livones.net Livones!
In the Book section, articles, links and videos about Livonian theme are gathered and grouped.
We wish you luck in learning about Livonian culture!
Libians are the basic nation of Latvia of the Baltic Sea Finnish origin, which played a major role in the development of modern Latvian language and culture.
The modern Latvian language has been formed in contact with the Livonian and ancient white tribes – Latin, underminded and whose – and this interaction is based on its unique sound.
Similarly, the influence of the Livs is felt in various fields of Latvian traditional and contemporary culture, from folklor to culinary heritage.
This is why traditional Livonian culture is included in the Latvian Culture Canon and the Preamble of the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia emphasizes the role of Livonian traditions in the formation of Latvian identity.
The Livonian has been able not only to preserve the nature of its language and culture, but also to develop it by joining the contemporary cultural space of Latvia.
The Liv language belongs to the Ural language family of the Baltic Sea Finnish language group, unlike the Latvian language, which is part of the Indo-European group of white languages.
The Liv language is the language of Estonian, Finnish and warrior, the further languages of the Sami, Hungarian, Mordwich and other Ural family.
The Liv language is included in the UNESCO Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger as a critically endangered language.
In Latvia, the status of the Liv language is defined in Section 4 of the State Language Law, which states: “The State ensures preservation, protection and development of the Liv language as an indigenous (author) language.”
The Liv language as part of the traditional Liv culture has also been incorporated into the Latvian Culture Canoe since 2009.
In 19th century, about 3,000 people spoke Livonianly, about 1,500 language skills in the mid-20th century, but nowadays, about 30 people around the world have been able to communicate well.
The number of people who have obtained the basics of the Liv language is constantly growing.
The knowledge of the Liv language and also its skills are important to understand the Latvian language, because both languages have been influenced in long-term interaction.
While there are few linguistic skills, the Liv language is very important for ural researchers because it is natural and includes many ancient characteristics.
It is also important for the Livonian people to have language skills, because it is always the basis for Livonian self-confidence.
It is possible to learn the Liv language today on a self-learning path, courses and camps, as well as in some universities.
I hope that in the future it will be possible to learn on the web too.
The Livonian is unique not only with its language and history, but also with rich and savvy cultural heritage, in which the section of the portal Traditional Culture provides insights.
The Livonian has established and continues to develop its modern culture – art, music and literature, the roots of which will be presented in almost 200 years of history.
The modern Livonian culture and its expressions can be found in the section of the portal Modern Culture.
The section of the store gathers the most diverse publicly available information about the Livonian people.
There are studies on Livonian history and culture (language studies can be found in the section of lingua.livones.net), books, web resources, video etc.
The section is constantly updated with new publications and news.
The documentary by Enna Sede (Enn Säde) was filmed in 1988-1990.
It sees Oskars Stalte, Elfrīds Žagare, Alfons Bertholds, Paulīne Kļaviņa, Andris Zēbergs, Irma Fridrihsone.

Viktoram Bertholdam – 100 for the Livonian, fisherman and healer
Viktors was in many ways the last. The last one in the family, while his wife Martha was still alive (born in Liedane 1925–1994), daily communication took place in Livonian, one of the Liv language researchers driving to Estonian and Finnish scientists, and the last one with whom on the same coast was freely consumed in the native Liv language.

Viktors Bertholds lived a large part of life in Kolka.
In the case of the Lithuanian, he really agreed in the latest times, when the Liv language speakers had remained little when each speaker had become a special value.
In the early 90s Viktors taught Liv language to collectors along with Mart.
Is it a good idea to get rid of it all the time?
Viktors Bertholds was born on 16 January 1921 in the family of Livonian Carl and Mary Bertholds in Vaide Jeancos.
The jungles for at least six generations were home to the vast and Livonianly strong birth of Bertholdu, in which several important personalities in the Liv cultural history grew.
Both with brother Alfon Berthold (Livonian poet, folklorist) growing firmly in the Livonian family, they kept the Liv language alive all their life.
It was the best speakers of the native Liv language nowadays.

Daughter Ārija Bertholde, who has moved to life with daughter Baibu since 1995, remembered:
We always talked in our home everyday.
Also when parents did not want children to understand what they were talking about.
I wanted to learn the language.
I know only a few words now, and some songs remain in memory.
I think I could read because I remember that my mother taught me how to read it.
When I asked her why I didn’t learn the language, she replied that it was an unidentified and unauthorized language.

2011 - YEAR OF THE COUNCIL AND CULTURE
The International Livonian Friends Society and Society Līvõ Kultūr sidām (Livonian Culture Centre) has decided to declare 2011 as the International Year of Livonian Language and Culture.
This has a number of prerequisites – both cultural history related to important anniversary and topical, since 2011 is marked by a number of unique events.
In 2011, 150 years have passed since A. J. Šēgrēna and F. J. Vīdemaņ came out in Peterburg in German, the first Liv language grammar and dictionary that also included the first samples of Liv folklore, poetry and religious texts.
The following year is 90 years since the first time book of content in the Liv language was published – Livonian first reading book (Livonian first reading book), with which the Estonian Academic Born Language Society (Akadeemiline Emakeele Selts) launched a series of publications.
The first periodic publication of Livonian newspaper Līvli (Livonian) began 80 years ago with the support of the Finnish Academic Nurse National Club (Akateeminen Heimoklubi).
The first Livonian apple was written by Kārlis Stalte, 75 years ago, according to the order of the Estonian Academic Home Language Society, which was found five years ago in the Estonian National Archives.
The Livonian Coast (Livonian Coast) was founded 20 years ago and Livonians have been recognized as the foundation of Latvia in the Law “On the free development of national and ethnic groups and the right to cultural autonomy of Latvia”.
It is also five years since the Livonian Culture and Language portal livones.lv is operating – the only media to provide information in Livonian, Latvian, English and partly in Estonian and Finnish.
The Liv language and culture are not just historical values covered by decades and hundreds of dust.
It remains a source of significant research and discoveries enriching modern cultural life and providing discoveries that have not only scientific, but also practical importance.
In 2011, the largest Livonian-Estonian-Latvian dictionary will be published in Estonia.
It has been formed by prof. em. Tits Reins Vītso, the most outstanding Liv language researcher of modern times, using various Liv text stocks, including the collection of Livonian Pēteris Dambergs.
The new dictionary, which includes Liv language grammar, will be the perfect training tool with authentic language examples.

Post-name
The Liv language is an ancient Finnish family-owned Latvian indigenous language.
In the 12th century, it was talked about the territory of modern Latvia around the Gulf of Riga, the northern part of the Kurzeme peninsula, the lieutenant of Gauja and Daugava, as well as modern Riga and its surroundings.

However, in the mid-19th century, the Liv language was still spoken in two places of Latvia.
It’s important to note that you have the right to receive information about your personal data.
The Liv language disappeared here a short time later.
And on the Livonian coast, which consists of 14 North Kurzeme coastal fishing villages from Oviš to Ģipkā, about 2500 people spoke in Kurzeme Livonian language.
In the 20th century, the number of Liv language speakers also decreased on the coast of Livonia.
This was contributed by both World Wars and Soviet occupation, but the Livonians themselves and their supporters from among other Finnish nations and in Latvia participated actively in the preservation and development of the Liv language and culture.
In the 1950s, the border regime was introduced across the Livonian coast.
Fishing, which had long been the main activity of the Livonian people, and access to the sea was restricted, thereby forcing the Livonians to leave their native homes.
So many Livonians went to search for work in big cities – most to Riga and Germany.
The islands remained empty and the last territory, where the Liv language was spoken in all villages, ceased to exist.

The Livonian is now primarily located in Riga, Ventspils, Kolka and other parts of Latvia.

Today, the Liv language is listed in UNESCO’s World Endangered Language List.
There are only a little more than 20 people in the world who are able to talk in the Liv language.
However, there are three poets among them, who are also the authors of this book.
It is therefore possible to say that while Livonian literature is certainly the smallest number of readers in Europe, it is also likely the largest if the number of Livonian and Livonian speakers is counted.
The influence and importance of the Liv language and culture will go much further than it might seem after the current number of Liv language or Liv language skills.
The Libians played an important role in the history of the Baltic region and in the development of modern Latvian language and Latvian culture.
There are many Latvian writers, composers, artists, statemen and other intellectuals who have come from the Livonian people, also nowadays.
After the loss of language and land, the Livonians have been small keepers of their self-confidence and heritage that have helped the Liv language and culture keep up to today.
It is also important that the Livs developed their modern culture in addition to the preservation of traditional culture for almost two hundred years.
It has been formed over a long period of time together with the contemporary cultures of the Livonian neighbouring nations – Latvian and Estonian.
This means that the Livs have not only preserved their language skills and traditions until now, but also developed the language of their articles and modern cultural traditions visible in the works of contemporary Livs poets, artists, composers and performers.
The early stages of the Liv writing
The first names of the Liv language are found in the Livonian Indrik Chrononikā written already in the 13th century, which is an important document in the research of the history of the Livonian and whole Baltic region.
The first texts in the Liv language could be printed in the 16th century.
However, most of the Liv language texts issued before the mid-19th century were primarily written as samples of the language that were not intended for the Livs themselves. These were also the first Liv language books printed in London in 1863 – translations of the evangelical of the Mathematics in the western and eastern section of Kurzeme Liv language.
The first directly Livonian book, also the translation of the Gospel of Mathematics, which was made using both previously published translations, came out only in Peterburg in 1880.
However, the first samples of the literature in the Liv language came into existence as early as the mid-19th century, when Peterburg academys Anders Johans Šēgrens and Ferdinands Johans Vīdemanis arrived at the Livs.
The first Liv language grammar compiled by them along with samples of the language and the Liv-German-Liv dictionary came out in Peterburg in 1861.
The first samples of Livian literature are also found among the samples of other languages (speakings, folk songs, descriptions of traits, etc.) - poetry written by Jānis Princis and his son Peter Princis.
If you’re going to be a good friend, you’re going to be a good friend, you’re going to be a good friend.
He later moved to life in Ventspils, where he laid foundations for the part of Ventspils city – Ostgalam (one of Ventspils streets – Princes Street – named Princes family).
The Prince lived there until the end of his life.
He was given a great talent of a linguist and a writer.
This is both his new names of the Liv language, which he offered to both of the researchers mentioned above, and his articles in Latvian newspapers at the time.
It’s also important to note that you have the right to receive information about your personal data.
And he also made some translations.
The Princess’ eldest had the idea that future generations should maintain beautiful, clean and rich Liv language and show that the Liv language is the same cultural language as any other major European language.
This is why Jānis Princis might have written his first poems in the Liv language and created the first translations.
Jānis Princis is also important for Latvian literature.
It’s a good idea to get rid of it all the time.
It was the second collection of original poetry in Latvian literature history.

The texts she wrote also make it suppose that history might have been different.
If Jānis Princis had been able to learn more about cultural life elsewhere, not only in the fishermen’s village world, he might have become a significant and bright 19th century cultural personality not only in the context of Latvia and the Baltics, but perhaps even throughout Europe.

The Livonian literature began to develop rapidly after World War I, when the ideas of 19th century national romance were widely spread in Europe, and many new national countries developed suddenly after the collapse of the vast empires.
When the crumbs of the Russian empire grew into new independent countries – Latvia, Estonia and Finland – the Livonians, which were an important part of the history of the region, came to the attention again. Special attention was paid to the Livonian researchers and cultural staff of Estonia and Finland.
They were encouraged by the idea of racial nations – a number of Finnish-speaking nations primarily in Indo-European-speaking Europe.
The work of these researchers and cultural staff was also affected by the fact that other Finnish people, other than the Sams and Hungarians, were difficult to access for research and cooperation because they had remained in the newly established Soviet Union.
The activity of these researchers and creative people was also affected by the fact that research and cooperation with other Finnish nations, other than the Sams and Hungarians, was difficult because they were located in the territory of the established Soviet Union.
This is why the interest of several Finnish and Estonian researchers unexpectedly focused on the Livonian people, they started working with Livonian research and assistance, and both nations largely supported the Livonian language and cultural preservation efforts.
The first and most notable of such researchers who arrived on the shore of Lībiešus were Lauri Ketunens (Lauri Kettunen; 1885–1963) – Finnish, Professor of the Baltic Sea Finnish language at the University of Tartu and author of the Livonian-German dictionary issued in 1938, and Estonian Oskars Lorits (Oskar Loorits; 1900–1961), student of L. Ketunen at the time and at the latest a Livonian folklore collector and researcher.
In addition to the collection of Liv language and cultural materials already during its first expedition in Livonian villages in 1920, both scientists began talking about the need for Livonians to pay more attention to their heritage, it must be preserved and developed.
They therefore contributed to the creation and development of Livonian cultural life – the establishment of choirs and the first Livonian public organisation Līvu Union (Livonian Union), teaching Livonian language in school – and participated in other activities.
One of the most important successes of these researchers was creating the possibility of issuing Liv texts.
In 1921, L. Ketunens and O. Lorits issued the first Livonian reading book and continued the release of such reading books until 1926.
In addition to the folklore and the authors themselves, Livonian poems and stories were also included in the reading books.
This book and later published monthly book “Līvli” (1931–1939) became a means of development of Liv literature, in which both previously written and new Liv authors could publish their works during the interwar period.
It should be noted that during this time and in Livonian history, the most popular genre of literature has been poetry.
It is also well understood because poetry has always been popular at the neighbours of the Livonian.
It is important to note that you have the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right to receive the right.
It was also important for many Liv authors, who mainly were fishermen and operated much more on a daily basis with airs and nets than feathers and paper.
The most significant literature of this time was Kārlis Stalte (Kōrli Stalte; 1870–1947) – poet, translator, Livonian cultural preserver and developer.
It’s a good idea to get rid of it, and it’s a good idea.
In addition, he was also editor of the "Līvli" magazine (1933–1939) and a translator who translated the Livonian New Betting.
However, Mr Stalte is most widely known for his timely and spiritual poems in the Liv language.
K. Stalte began writing before World War I.
In the 1920s and 1930s, he was the most charismatic Liv poet and also the author of the first Liv poetry collection (Livonian songs; 1924) published in Tallinn.
In his fiction, K. Stalte focuses most on Livonian life, he writes about Livonian patriotic and spiritual things.
But his poems are versatile – they contain simple, folklore-induced children’s poems and fine sonets.
It is particularly important that many of his poems have been compiled simultaneously as song texts for the purposes of the Livonian Choirs (he is also the author of the Livian anthem).
The same can be said for some other Liv poets.
This is why singers are often even almost sure to sing folk songs, although this song is written by a recognizable Liv poet.
In the late 1930s, K. Stalte also compiled a handwritten Liv reading book, which was published only in 2011, which was the International Year of Liv Language and Culture.
The poems included in this book are considered excellent samples of Livonian literature.
The same goes for the stories written by Mr Stalte, originally designed for children, but depicts the world so life and truly, with the help of such a good and beautiful Liv language, that reading them will bring true joy to every Liv language learner.
It’s a good idea to get rid of it, but it’s a good idea.
The first samples of the Livonian prose, however, were issued a little earlier, in the third Livonian reading book (1923).
It was compiled by Augusts Skadiņš and the publication of the book was supported by the Estonian Society of Resistance (Estonian Karskusliit).
In the book A. Skadiņš included several stories about fighting alcohol, which he had written himself.
In 1935, in Finland, Peter Damberg’s book of Mother’s Language was printed for school and home (Brith Language Reader for School and Home), which became one of the most important spending of his time.
In addition to translations, Liv Liv literary poems and stories can be found in the book, some of which are written by P. Damberg himself.
Pēteris Dambergs was a very important person in Liv literature and contemporary culture.
He acted in several fields – wrote and poetized Livonian poetry, German and translated into Livonian folklore, developed Livonian language, was an adviser to Livonian cultural and language researchers, participated in the compilation of several dictionaries (e.g., Livonian-Latvian-esperanto dictionary).
He maintained the life of the Livonian culture during the Soviet occupation.
In the 1930s, P. Damberg participated in the release of “Līvli” of the month when he studied at Jelgava teacher’s seminar.
Peter Damberg wrote the most poetry.
His poetry has a wide range of languages and multi-layer structures.
He wrote several of his memory stories, considered one of the best samples of the Livonian prosa.
In 1967 Damberg also compiled a handwriting of new Liv reading books.
It finds samples of the socialist realisticism of the Soviet time that are not present in other Liv publications.
During the period between the two World Wars, almost all Livonian cultural staff participated in Livonian literary life: both West Liv poet Uldriķis Kāpbergs (Uļi Kīnkamäg), who at the time entered the Latvian prison because of his Livonian patriotic views and whom is therefore known in Latvia by the Latvian press titled “Levonian King”, the latest leader of the Livonian Union Didriķis Vālgamā (Didrek Vālgamaa; 1884–1968), artist Jānis Belte (Jāņ Belt; 1893–1946), pastor Edgars Vālgamā (Egar Vaalgamaa; 1912–2003) and many others, including Livonian researchers Lauri Ketunens and Oskars Lorits.
In the case of the number of readers, the most active time in Livonian literature was the interwar period.
However, as can be seen from Peter Damberg's example, the creation of Livonian literature continued also after World War II, although its extradition possibilities were significantly limited.
The poetry of some authors, such as Alfon Bertholda (Alfon Bertholda; 1900–1993) and Paulīne Kļaviņa (Poulīn Kļaviņa; 1918–2001), was published in scientific publications in Estonia.
However, most of the literary works that were made during this time remained in handwritten.
When Latvia recovered independence, the issue of Livian literature continued.

The Latvian capital is Riga on the shore of the Great Daugava.
There is a national government.
Is it possible to get rid of it in your life?
They bring goods from foreign countries and carry goods from Latvia to abroad.
In addition, we have warships that protect the shore of Latvia, where we, the Livonian, live.
The Coast
We live in Livonian villages on the seaside.
Green forest, blue sea and white sand stalks are what we see here every day.
As good playing as white seaside sands are nowhere for children.
There can also be a collection of glitters.
Sometimes there is a lot on the shore.
The boys prepare ships from pine peel, put them masts, pie masts paper bursts and put them to swim.
The wind drives ships off the coast until they get on top of the ground, where waves turn them around.
If you want, you can also go to the sea.

Children are not getting to the second seed, the jom is already too deep.
In the second area, water is cooler than in the lower area.
If the weather is clear, the other side of the sea is visible in Saaremaa.
The White Sāmsala beacon is almost always visible.
The ships travel across the sea, and fishermen's boats are visible both on the sea and on the shore.
Fishermen from the sea most transfer butts, hemps and shrimps.
Is it possible to get rid of it in the future?
Game
We go to the shore,
You go to the shore,
All fishermen in our village go to the shore.
We go to the sea,
You go to the sea,
All fishermen in our village go to the sea.
We go to the edge,
You go to the edge,
All fishermen in our village go to the edge.
We go home,
You go home,
All the fishermen in our village go home.
Spring
Spring on the shore is late.
It is made in the sea of ice that gives the cold.
However, when spring is present, it is also beautiful.
The Livonian thinks that there is nowhere as beautiful spring as on the shore.
The carcasses and threads have a coat.
In the apples, trees blossom around which san bees while searching for honey.
It’s important to note that you have the right to collect your personal data for the purpose of protecting your personal data and your personal data.
The rivers and streams are full of water, they run in a light stream to the sea side, noiseing with their bubbles.
Fishermen can go to sea again and livestock is brought to herds.
When the cows have been in herds for the first time, the herds, to have more milk, are grounded in the evening.
Shepherds water up against it.
In addition, children also participate, and this evening no one appears if children have wet clothes.
The sun, during winter nights, has gone,
In a foreign country, fishermen have been warming up.
In the spring she has come back to us again,
When he comes from here, he is quietly snowed.
I have a cold of winter, Ice,
As far as you can see, the sea remains open.
The fishermen are now thrown into the seanet again,
The fish will pull them out later.
When you go to the sea, come aside, they will not forget it,
that they have been given time-to-day fishing work.
Summer
When John’s Day is over, there’s summer too.
In the evening of John, people go to the shore.
There is an old boat that is loaded, and there is a fire towed.
It’s important to note that you have the right to receive information about your personal data.

In the summer, townmen go out to coastal villages to live in order to be able to swim in the sea.
Fishermen are also now experiencing the greatest trap fishing time.
Former fishermen wolf run ropes with their hands in the field, now ropes are much taller and rarer, too, the ropes themselves are much bigger, and ropes are now pulled out with motorboat machines.
In the autumn, there are bursts already on the sea.
Only in warm weather they don't catch much.
The great joy for children in the summer is that they can go berries to read and eat.
Strawberries, blueberries and raspberries are already ready.
The Livonian Song
Listen, children, I will say the nuance as the devil sings:
It sings, “Window!”
It sings, “Love!”
It sings, “Vitch the windshield!”
It sings, “Vitch the map!”
It sings: “Vitch windshield, vitch map,
Vitch windshield, vitch map,
Vitch windshield, vitch map,
The char!"
Autumn
When the cereal is ready and littered, autumn begins.
Days are short and nights are long.
The star has long disappeared from his nest, and singing poultry is no longer heard.
They've all gone from us to warm lands where there's no snow and cold.
The forests remain white, only the blazing of the gates is heard most in the evenings when they will feed the boats, looking for a place where they can sleep at the ends of the trees night.
Fishermen have come the greatest fishing time.
They bring to the edge both burrows and herrings.
There is work on the beach all day.
When the nets are cleaned, they are littered free, and fishermen, just getting to eat, are removed again so that they can bind and throw in again.
The air and also the water in the sea have become cold, no one can swim anymore.
If the net cleaners frost their fingers, they spark fire on the seaside, at which they can warm their hands and warm up themselves.
People rush to the ground to be ready for next spring's seed.
And when the potatoes are harvested, the earth freezing, victories appear in the sea, later ice, and winter is present.
Born language
The seamen's language, my native language,
Sacred I have your voice.
Who can forget the seamen's language,
Also forget your mother’s name.
The seamen’s language was spoken old,
torture seafarers,
In the seamen's language, songs were singing,
In the seamen’s language, God prayed.
The seamen's language speak
Because we love; –
Let's be like our fathers:
Livonian like stones hard.
Winter
The cold and snow on our Livonian coast is rare before Christmas.
When they have passed with trees, candles and gifts for good children, winter begins.
The weather is getting cold, and snow is snow.
The wheels are now laid aside, and everyone rides with horns and champions along white snow.
It’s also important to note that you have the right to receive information about your personal data.
In winter, children need to go to school and learn sincerely.
When schoolworks are made, it is time to go outside to play, measure the depth of snow cushions and build snowviruses.
It is also possible to run with slides, and with small witches, you can drop down from the mountain so that the wind in your ears alone chalk.
The sea is filled with ice, and ice creaming is often heard when it conducts other vessels through ice.
If there is a particularly cold winter, the ships need to stay on site, then the strong ice cream is no longer able to help.
Everyone is waiting for spring with the sun that will melt all the snow and ice.

But the sleeping old stumbled forward with long steps, went on to bring sleep to other children too.

Everyone slept.
I heard talking and chatting in the second room.
I was breaking out of bed and going to watch.
I was standing in the doorstep.

The slow doll and the mother's coffee can celebrated the wedding.
Both had paper roses at the chest and the doll kept a coffee can behind the handle.
The wedding was full of floors.
The cat and the spat played music, the others all dancoed.
The charcoal stains were cut with stamp, the father's filament boots jumped with a furnace crust.
All of the jeans are loosely cast.
Coffee cups and tea glasses late as a fireplace from one wall to the other.

Valter Lang: early contacts of Baltic Finnish and white, according to archaeological and linguistic data.
Long and intensive contacts between the Baltic Finnish and white tribes resulted in the linguistic and material collapse of the cultures of these two different language groups.
This article focuses on some interesting relationships between the two cultures while trying to explain and illustrate language contacts using archaeological data.
Firstly, some semantic related groups of white hiccups in proto-Swedish will be analyzed to determine their borrowing time and place.
One of the evidence of the intensity of these contacts is the acquisition of the Finnish name Kalev/Kaleva from the white fork/call, which was first mentioned in my previous article in Estonian (Lang 2012).

Petri Kallio: Historic phonology from proto-Soma to proto-Livonian.
This article serves as an attempt to reconstruct the approximate chronological sequence of the main sound laws between (left) proto-Soma and proto-Libian.
The by-product of this study is the reconstruction of the proto-Livonian background system, which previous versions have been more fragmented and preliminary.
In the end, it is briefly discussed when and where the proto-ling of the Livonian language was spoken before its division in Kurzeme and Salacas Livonian languages.
Patrick O’Rourke, Karl Pajusalu: Liv language features in Estonian slopes.
This article introduces linguistic innovations characteristic of both Kurzeme and Salacas Liv language and is also known in neighbouring Estonian dialect regions.
These innovative features are phonological, morphological and morphosintactive.
These features mainly occur in the western and southwest of Estonia, but also in more specific areas close to the current western border between Estonia and Latvia.
The widespread shared features can mostly be explained as Western Finnish-like innovations, unless they have been demonstrated to have been caused by contact with German or white languages.
The features, which are spread in the direct proximity of the former Liv language area, can be classified as the subdivisions of the western and island Estonian language of the Liv language.
Christi Salve: Secret through Salatsi: Place names in songs of Estonian spaces related to Livonian settlements.
The article seeks the answer to the question of whether there are references to the Livs in the songs of Estonian Ruins.
Using materials from Estonian Ruins song database, the article tracks some names of countries, rivers and cities.
The name of Kurzeme proved extremely popular; however, it appears in very different contexts.
Tuuli Tuisk: The main features and pronunciation of the Lithuanian sound system.
The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the Liv sound system and pronunciation.
As regards variations in Liv dialects, the main difference is between the Eastern and western Liv language, while the central Liv language forms a transitional zone.
The Liv language is based on the Eastern Kurzeme dialect.
This article focuses on standard pronunciation by discussing variations a little bit.
The sounds and sounds are looked at separately.
In addition, prosodical features of the Liv language are discussed.
The Liv language stands out as Baltic Finnish, influenced by white – Latvian.
Unlike many other Baltic Finnish languages, there are balcony locks and hairstyles that can be expressed as long gems.
The Liv language contains a large number of short and long monophtongus, diphtongues and triptongues.
Tiit-Rein Viitso: The existing joint in the Liv language.
In the Liv language there is a small set of word forms that mark the place or time and answer questions where? and when? and based on the ends of their foldings, they can be considered an existing form of joint, like similar forms in other Baltic Finnish languages.
The article examines these forms and related forms of Latin, sublative and excessive folding that answers questions about where?, what time? and where?, from which time?, and their history.
In addition, the forms of words formally identical to the dative forms but are used as the status stop words are existing forms of the joint obtained from the date, and their uses are identified.

Renate Blumberga: Livonian language used in the letters in the 1930s: insight into Livonian editors’ list.
This article shows that it is possible to find new words in sources that have been little used in linguistic research so far and that it is possible to supplement the Liv language vocabulary with the only two editors of the 1930s Liv language newspaper.
Examples of the Livonian-Estonian-Latvian Livonian dictionary show the new types of names and backgrounds used by Livonian editors in their list, and whether they reflect the forms found in the 2012 Livonian-Estonian-Latvian dictionary, the largest project devoted to the Livonian language in recent years.
On the basis of these examples, a brief analysis shows whether the spelling and grouping of these words by type of declining is consistent or there is a need for change in this regard.
It has been concluded that “in the Livonian-Estonian-Latvian dictionary” there is a considerable variety of forms of declining to be simplified for the following groups of borrowed words: 1) the names ending in Latvian with -ar, -ar and -ar; 2) the names ending in Latvian with -or, -or; 3) the names ending in Latvian with -al, -al, -al, and in Livonian with -al, 4) the characteristics of the names ending in Latvian with -al and -al.
It is also concluded that, in the newly created words, especially the borrowed internationalism, the principles of word-making are not consistently respected.
In addition, this article provides examples of potential new words that could be added to the Liv Liv Liv Liv Liv dictionary.
